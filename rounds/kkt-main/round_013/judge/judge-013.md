Summary:

Round 13 is a successful reduction-and-audit round, not a proof round. The real-parameter KKT conjecture is still not closed by the material in this round. The strongest certified progress is that the endpoint-cap localization has now been upgraded to a theorem-level reduction, modulo small boundary-case bookkeeping. In particular, the right endpoint residual problem in the variable

$$
u=\frac{B(1-x)}{2},\qquad B=n+\alpha+\beta+1,
$$

is confined to

$$
0\le u\le u_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n
$$

for $n\ge1$, and the finite-$B$ endpoint equation

$$
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0
$$

has a monotone Sonin product

$$
K_B(u)=p_B(u)q_B(u).
$$

The forbidden-zone ascent lemma is now essentially proved: for $\alpha>0$, the regular endpoint solution is positive and increasing before the first zero of $q_B$ or $K_B$. Therefore there is no pre-turning-point local maximum. Combined with Sonin monotonicity on the allowed side, this gives the main Round 13 reduction: any remaining endpoint-cap failure must occur at the first critical point after the first turning point.

The amplitude certificate is still open. Round 13 gives strong evidence that the naive constant-frequency Bessel approximation, the rational-coordinate “amplitude-fix” hope, and the direct Laguerre-to-finite-$B$ perturbation bridge are too crude in the $\alpha=O(n)$ transition strip. These are not all formally disproved as mathematical possibilities, but they should no longer be the main proof route in their naive forms. The next round should focus on a dynamic first-lobe amplitude theorem: either a regularized Prüfer/Airy argument or a fully variable-frequency Szegő/Liouville-Green transformation with explicit constants. A4 should simultaneously build a numerical test harness, but interval arithmetic remains a proof only after a large-$n$ analytic reduction is available.

Selected main route:

The selected route for Round 14 is:

**Endpoint-cap first-lobe route with dynamic amplitude control.**

The proof skeleton should now be:

1. Use the existing global modules to reduce to the right endpoint residual cap:
   - central contour clearance;
   - weighted-energy clearance;
   - small right-endpoint exponent theorem for $0\le\alpha\le1/2$;
   - symmetry for the left endpoint;
   - separate base cases $n=0$, $\alpha=0$, $\beta=0$, and the boundary $\alpha=1/2$.

2. In the residual right endpoint range,

$$
n\ge1,\qquad \alpha>1/2,\qquad \beta\ge0,
$$

set

$$
B=n+\alpha+\beta+1,\qquad H(u)=g_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}\left(1-\frac{2u}{B}\right).
$$

3. Use the exact endpoint equation

$$
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0,
$$

where

$$
p_B(u)=u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)
$$

and

$$
q_B(u)
=
n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B}
-
\frac{\left(\left(1-\frac{n+1}{B}\right)u-\alpha\right)^2}
{4u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)}.
$$

4. Use the cap bound

$$
0\le u\le u_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n.
$$

5. Use the product identity

$$
K_B(u)=p_B(u)q_B(u)
=
-\frac{\alpha^2}{4}+\Lambda_Bu-\Delta_Bu^2,
$$

where

$$
r_B=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{B}=1-\frac{n+1}{B},
$$

$$
c_B=n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B},
$$

$$
\Lambda_B=c_B+\frac{\alpha r_B}{2},
\qquad
\Delta_B=\frac{c_B}{B}+\frac{r_B^2}{4}.
$$

Then $K_B$ is concave, and

$$
K_B'(u_\sigma)
=
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2B}.
$$

Moreover, because

$$
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2(n+\alpha+\beta+1)}
\ge \frac{\alpha}{2},
$$

one has the sharpened cap lower bound

$$
K_B'(u)\ge K_B'(u_\sigma)\ge\frac{\alpha}{2}\ge\frac14
$$

throughout the residual right endpoint range $\alpha\ge1/2$.

6. Prove and record the forbidden-zone ascent lemma. If $u_0$ is the first zero of $q_B$ or equivalently $K_B$ in the cap, then on $(0,u_0)$ one has $q_B<0$, while the regular Frobenius branch satisfies

$$
H(u)\sim A_{n,\alpha,B}u^{\alpha/2},\qquad A_{n,\alpha,B}>0.
$$

With

$$
W(u)=p_B(u)H'(u),
$$

the ODE gives

$$
W'(u)=-q_B(u)H(u)>0
$$

as long as $H>0$ and $q_B<0$. Since $H>0$ and $W>0$ near zero, the solution remains positive and increasing up to $u_0$. Therefore there is no local maximum in the forbidden zone.

7. On the allowed side $q_B>0$, use the cap Sonin functional

$$
S_B(u)=H(u)^2+\frac{p_B(u)H'(u)^2}{q_B(u)}.
$$

It satisfies

$$
S_B'(u)
=
-\frac{K_B'(u)}{q_B(u)^2}H'(u)^2\le0.
$$

Thus local extrema in the allowed portion of the cap are nonincreasing in amplitude as $u$ increases from the endpoint toward the central boundary.

8. Conclude the first-lobe reduction. Let $u_1$ be the first critical point of $H$ after $u_0$, if it exists. Then the residual endpoint cap is controlled once one proves

$$
|H(u_1)|
\le
T_{n,\alpha,\beta}
=
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}.
$$

If no such $u_1$ exists, the cap maximum lies at the central boundary already controlled by the central module, or is controlled by monotonicity from the endpoint.

The remaining proof problem is exactly this first-critical-point amplitude estimate. Round 14 should no longer treat the global Laguerre inequality on $0\le u<\infty$ as the primary target. The Laguerre cap and the $\beta=\infty$ face remain essential diagnostics, but the selected main route is a finite-$B$ first-lobe theorem.

Useful fragments by source:

### A1

A1 supplied the cleanest theorem-level synthesis of the endpoint-cap reduction.

Useful fragments:

1. A1 stated the exact finite-$B$ endpoint equation in the right endpoint variable and kept the normalization consistent with the KKT target.

2. A1 gave the cap length identity

$$
u_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n.
$$

This remains one of the main advances of the recent rounds because it eliminates the need to prove a global Laguerre bound on $0\le u<\infty$.

3. A1 formulated the first-lobe reduction precisely: the remaining cap estimate reduces to bounding the first critical point after the first turning point.

4. A1 gave a convincing sign-based proof of forbidden-zone ascent. This was the most important qualitative addition of Round 13, because previous Sonin arguments only applied where $q_B>0$.

5. A1 correctly did not claim an amplitude theorem. A1’s conclusion that the endpoint-cap route is still the best strategy is adopted.

Corrections or cautions:

A1’s recommendation of a direct finite-$B$ Prüfer/Sonin route is reasonable, but it needs an Airy-layer or modified Prüfer initialization at the turning point. Standard Prüfer variables are singular when $K_B(u_0)=0$. The next round must not skip this issue.

### A2

A2’s most valuable contribution was obstruction analysis.

Useful fragments:

1. A2 re-derived the rational endpoint coordinate

$$
v=B\frac{1-x}{1+x},
\qquad
x=\frac{B-v}{B+v},
$$

with

$$
u=\frac{Bv}{B+v},
\qquad
v=\frac{Bu}{B-u}.
$$

The cap maps to

$$
0\le v\le v_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B-1}.
$$

2. A2 verified the rational-coordinate equation

$$
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0,
$$

with

$$
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
$$

3. A2 emphasized the key invariant identity

$$
\widehat K_B(v):=v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v)).
$$

This means the rational coordinate preserves the Sonin invariant product rather than creating a new monotonicity or amplitude mechanism. The rational coordinate may still be useful for stable computation or for a cleaner normal form, but it is not a “free” Liouville-Green amplitude fix.

4. A2 correctly warned that constant-frequency Bessel approximations are likely too lossy in the $\alpha=O(n)$ transition strip. The Volterra scaling argument is a serious obstruction search.

5. A2 correctly warned that a Sonin handoff at or near the turning point is invalid unless the derivative-energy term is controlled. The functional

$$
H^2+\frac{p_BH'^2}{q_B}
$$

has a pole as $q_B\to0^+$ unless the derivative term is handled.

6. A2’s finite-$B$ versus Laguerre frequency drift warning is important. The identity

$$
\Lambda_\infty-\Lambda_B
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)(n+1)}{2B}
$$

shows that direct finite-$B$ perturbation from the Laguerre face is not uniformly small in the semi-discrete regime $\beta=0$, especially when $\alpha=O(n)$.

Corrections or cautions:

A2 overstates several negative conclusions. The round should record these as warnings, not impossibility theorems. A model Volterra integral with $O(n)$ growth does not by itself rule out every Bessel-based method, every renormalized Bessel comparison, or a dynamic Liouville-Green construction. It does reject the naive constant-frequency route unless someone supplies a sharper transformed error with explicit constants.

### A3

A3 was the strongest algebra auditor.

Useful fragments:

1. A3 independently verified the affine endpoint equation, the cap length, and the quadratic product structure.

2. A3 sharpened the monotonicity estimate to

$$
K_B'(u)\ge\frac{\alpha}{2}
$$

on the cap, hence

$$
K_B'(u)\ge\frac14
$$

in the residual right-endpoint strip $\alpha\ge1/2$.

3. A3 verified the rational-coordinate equation and the invariant identity

$$
v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v)).
$$

4. A3 supplied the Frobenius coefficient

$$
A_{n,\alpha,B}
=
B^{-\alpha/2}
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)}
{\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Gamma(n+1)}
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}.
$$

Equivalently,

$$
A_{n,\alpha,B}
=
B^{-\alpha/2}
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)}
$$

after simplification in the Bessel-matching form.

5. A3 re-derived the Bessel model normalization

$$
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}.
$$

This algebraic expression is accepted; estimates for it remain open.

Corrections or cautions:

A3’s detailed derivation of the endpoint ODE contains a false start involving a missing factor. The final formulas are correct, but the lemma-bank version should be rewritten cleanly. The correct transformation should explicitly show that

$$
\frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)g_x\right)=B(p_BH')'
$$

and

$$
\frac{F}{1-x^2}
=
\kappa
-
B\frac{(r_Bu-\alpha)^2}{4u(1-u/B)},
$$

so that dividing the full equation by $B$ gives the accepted $q_B$.

### A4

A4 was useful mainly as a numerical and certificate planner.

Useful fragments:

1. A4 correctly centered attention on the Bessel maximum

$$
B_*=\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|
$$

and the gamma/Bessel normalization $M_{n,\alpha,B}$.

2. A4 correctly rejected the older false value $2/\pi$ as the maximum for $J_{1/2}$.

3. A4 gave the right critical equation for the first positive maximum of $J_{1/2}$:

$$
\tan t=2t.
$$

The first solution is approximately

$$
t_1\approx1.1655611852072113,
$$

and

$$
J_{1/2}(t_1)\approx0.6791921047.
$$

A4’s reported value $0.67918418$ is slightly inaccurate, but the qualitative correction is right.

4. A4 gave a useful compactified interval-arithmetic plan using

$$
\theta=\frac{n+\alpha+1}{B}.
$$

For fixed $n$, this compactifies the finite-$B$ and Laguerre boundary faces into

$$
0\le\theta\le1.
$$

5. A4’s proposed use of the finite hypergeometric representation

$$
P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}\left(1-\frac{2u}{B}\right)
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)_n}{n!}
{}_2F_1\left(-n,B;\alpha+1;\frac{u}{B}\right)
$$

is the right basis for stable interval evaluation.

Corrections or cautions:

A4’s claimed closure is rejected. The claims

$$
M_{n,\alpha,B}\le1+\frac{1}{4n}
$$

and

$$
|H(u_1)|\le M_{n,\alpha,B}B_*+\mathrm{Error}
$$

are not proved. The assertion that the Olver error is “trivially” below the remaining slack is not acceptable. A4 also cited the monotonicity of the Bessel maximum in $\nu$ without proving it or stating a precise theorem with hypotheses. The next round should turn these into computations or citations, not proof claims.

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Claiming Round 13 proves KKT.**  
   Rejected. Round 13 proves no first-lobe amplitude theorem and no finite-$B$ bridge theorem with constants. The conjecture remains open in this workflow.

2. **Global Laguerre as the main proof target.**  
   Risky and no longer minimal. The cap restriction $0\le u\le n$ and the first-lobe reduction are strictly sharper. The Laguerre face remains a diagnostic and possible boundary component for interval arithmetic, but not the primary analytic target.

3. **Naive constant-frequency Bessel perturbation.**  
   Rejected as a main route unless re-derived with an exact dependent-variable transform and a bounded error functional. A2’s scaling analysis strongly suggests the error can grow in the $\alpha=O(n)$ region.

4. **Rational coordinate as an automatic amplitude fix.**  
   Rejected. The identity

$$
v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v))
$$

shows the rational coordinate preserves the same Sonin invariant product. It may help algebra or numerics, but it does not by itself remove WKB amplitude issues.

5. **Naive Laguerre-to-finite-$B$ perturbation.**  
   Rejected for the semi-discrete target. The finite-$B$ frequency may differ from the Laguerre limit by $O(n)$ when $\beta$ is small, especially when $\alpha=O(n)$. Any bridge must either be localized with strict margins or replaced by a direct finite-$B$ theorem.

6. **Sonin handoff at the turning point.**  
   Rejected. Since $q_B(u_0)=0$, the derivative-energy term in

$$
H^2+\frac{p_BH'^2}{q_B}
$$

cannot be ignored. Handoff must occur away from the turning point, with a full derivative-energy bound, or through an Airy/Prüfer regularization.

7. **A4’s Bessel maximum certificate as written.**  
   Not certified. The value for $J_{1/2}$ should be corrected to approximately $0.6791921047$, and the supremum over all $\nu\ge1/2$ requires a named theorem or interval proof.

8. **A4’s gamma-ratio bound as written.**  
   Not certified. Stirling heuristics are insufficient. The bound may be true in some form, but it needs explicit inequalities such as Binet, Gautschi, Kershaw, or Robbins bounds with tracked remainders.

9. **Unbounded or premature interval arithmetic.**  
   Interval arithmetic is valid only after a large-$n$ analytic theorem gives a finite $N_0$, or after the computation includes a fully rigorous infinite-family argument. A grid over many $n$ is not a proof by itself.

Known gaps:

### G13.1: First-lobe amplitude theorem

The central open theorem is:

For

$$
n\ge1,\qquad \frac12<\alpha<\alpha_E(n):=\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)}{2n+3},\qquad \beta\ge0,
$$

let $u_1$ be the first critical point after the first endpoint turning point in the cap. Prove

$$
|H(u_1)|
\le
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}.
$$

This is the main open gap.

### G13.2: Turning-point regularization

The forbidden-zone ascent is essentially proved, and Sonin monotonicity is clear where $q_B>0$. What remains is a polished bridge through the turning point. The proof should handle:

- no zero of $q_B$ in the cap;
- zero of $q_B$ at the cap boundary;
- first critical point absent;
- limiting application of Sonin monotonicity on $[u_0+\varepsilon,u_\sigma]$;
- Airy or modified Prüfer initialization if a dynamic amplitude proof starts at $u_0$.

### G13.3: Exact dynamic amplitude mechanism

The next proof must produce one of the following with explicit constants:

1. A modified Prüfer amplitude theorem through the first lobe, with controlled Airy-layer matching.

2. A Szegő/Liouville-Green transformation that absorbs the quadratic drift and leaves a Schwarzian residual whose integral is explicitly bounded.

3. A direct finite-$B$ comparison theorem not relying on constant-frequency Bessel approximation.

### G13.4: Actual Liouville-Green residual in $u$ and $v$

The panel needs the exact transformed normal forms, including dependent-variable normalization and Schwarzian terms. It is not enough to compare principal operators.

### G13.5: Bessel maximum theorem

A usable bound should be something like

$$
\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|<0.680,
$$

but this must be proved or cited precisely. The $\nu=1/2$ computation alone is not enough unless one proves the supremum over $\nu$ occurs there.

### G13.6: Gamma-ratio normalization

For the Bessel route, one needs a certified bound on

$$
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}.
$$

The proposed $1+O(1/n)$ bound is plausible near small $\alpha$ but not proved. The $\alpha=O(n)$ region should be studied separately because there may be exponential decay, but the transition between these regimes must be controlled.

### G13.7: Finite verification compactification

The compactified variables

$$
(\alpha,\theta,u),\qquad \theta=\frac{n+\alpha+1}{B},
$$

are useful. However, rigorous interval verification requires:

- a finite $N_0$ from analytic theory;
- stable treatment of the $\theta=0$ Laguerre face;
- interval Newton or subresultant isolation of critical points;
- exact treatment of endpoint and no-critical-point cases.

### G13.8: Boundary and equality cases

The following must be separated:

$$
n=0,\qquad \alpha=0,\qquad \beta=0,\qquad \alpha=\frac12,\qquad \beta=\frac12.
$$

The endpoint-reduction theorem assumes $\alpha>0$ for Frobenius ascent and $\alpha\ge1/2$ for the sharpened derivative lower bound. These edge cases must not be hidden inside generic statements.

New lemmas to add:

### Lemma L13.1: Exact affine endpoint equation

For $n\ge0$, $\alpha,\beta\ge0$, $B=n+\alpha+\beta+1$, and

$$
H(u)=g_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}\left(1-\frac{2u}{B}\right),
$$

one has

$$
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0,
$$

where

$$
p_B(u)=u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)
$$

and

$$
q_B(u)
=
n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B}
-
\frac{\left(\left(1-\frac{n+1}{B}\right)u-\alpha\right)^2}
{4u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)}.
$$

Status: certified. Add with a clean chain-rule proof.

### Lemma L13.2: Endpoint cap length

With

$$
\sigma=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{\alpha+\beta+2n},
$$

one has

$$
u_\sigma=\frac{B(1-\sigma)}{2}
=
\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n
$$

for $n\ge1$.

Status: certified.

### Lemma L13.3: Quadratic product and sharpened monotonicity

Let

$$
K_B(u)=p_B(u)q_B(u).
$$

Then

$$
K_B(u)
=
-\frac{\alpha^2}{4}+\Lambda_Bu-\Delta_Bu^2,
$$

where

$$
\Lambda_B=c_B+\frac{\alpha r_B}{2},
\qquad
\Delta_B=\frac{c_B}{B}+\frac{r_B^2}{4},
$$

with

$$
c_B=n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B},
\qquad
r_B=1-\frac{n+1}{B}.
$$

Moreover, $K_B$ is concave and

$$
K_B'(u_\sigma)
=
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2B}.
$$

Therefore, on $0\le u\le u_\sigma$,

$$
K_B'(u)\ge K_B'(u_\sigma)\ge\frac{\alpha}{2}.
$$

In the residual strip $\alpha\ge1/2$,

$$
K_B'(u)\ge\frac14.
$$

Status: certified.

### Lemma L13.4: Forbidden-zone ascent

Assume $\alpha>0$. Let $u_0$ be the first zero of $q_B$, equivalently $K_B$, in the cap. Then the regular endpoint solution $H$ is positive and strictly increasing on $(0,u_0)$.

Proof skeleton: use

$$
H(u)\sim A_{n,\alpha,B}u^{\alpha/2},\qquad A_{n,\alpha,B}>0,
$$

and

$$
(p_BH')'=-q_BH.
$$

Since $q_B<0$ on $(0,u_0)$ and $p_BH'>0$ near zero, $p_BH'$ stays positive and increasing, so $H'>0$.

Status: essentially certified; add exact treatment if no $u_0$ exists in the cap.

### Lemma L13.5: Cap Sonin monotonicity

On every subinterval where $q_B>0$,

$$
S_B(u)=H(u)^2+\frac{p_B(u)H'(u)^2}{q_B(u)}
$$

satisfies

$$
S_B'(u)
=
-\frac{K_B'(u)}{q_B(u)^2}H'(u)^2\le0.
$$

Status: certified.

### Lemma L13.6: First-lobe reduction

Assume the global modules reduce the proof to the right endpoint cap in the residual range $n\ge1$, $\alpha>1/2$, $\beta\ge0$. If $u_1$ is the first critical point after the first turning point $u_0$, then any failure of the cap estimate occurs at $u_1$. Hence it is enough to prove

$$
|H(u_1)|
\le
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}.
$$

If no $u_1$ exists, the cap is controlled by ascent plus central boundary control.

Status: nearly certified; requires boundary-case bookkeeping and a small limiting argument near $q_B=0$.

### Lemma L13.7: Rational-coordinate endpoint equation and invariant product

Set

$$
v=B\frac{1-x}{1+x},
\qquad
x=\frac{B-v}{B+v}.
$$

Then

$$
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0,
$$

where

$$
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
$$

The variables satisfy

$$
u=\frac{Bv}{B+v},
\qquad
v=\frac{Bu}{B-u},
$$

and

$$
v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v)).
$$

Status: certified. This should be recorded as an algebraic identity, not as an amplitude theorem.

### Lemma L13.8: Bessel normalization formula

For the Bessel model

$$
J_\alpha(2\sqrt{\Lambda_Bu}),
$$

the endpoint matching constant is

$$
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}.
$$

Status: certified algebraically. No upper bound for $M_{n,\alpha,B}$ is certified yet.

### Warning W13.1: Naive constant-frequency Volterra risk

In the $\alpha=O(n)$ transition strip, constant-frequency Bessel perturbation appears to have a large error integral. This is a serious obstruction, but should be recorded as a warning until the exact Liouville normal form and residual are derived.

Status: warning, not theorem.

### Warning W13.2: Naive Laguerre bridge risk

The finite-$B$ frequency can differ from the Laguerre limiting frequency by

$$
\Lambda_\infty-\Lambda_B
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)(n+1)}{2B},
$$

which is not uniformly small when $\beta$ is small and $\alpha=O(n)$.

Status: warning/theorem depending on the exact definitions of $\Lambda_\infty$ and $\Lambda_B$; A3 should audit before recording.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **Bessel maximum certificate.**  
   Rigorously enclose the first maximum of $J_{1/2}$ using

$$
\tan t=2t,
$$

and then prove or disprove that

$$
\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|
$$

is attained at $\nu=1/2$. If no theorem is cited, run an interval proof over $\nu$ and $t$.

2. **Gamma normalization envelope.**  
   Compute

$$
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}
$$

over the residual strip. Track the maximum of $M-1$ and test whether a bound like

$$
M\le1+\frac{C}{n+1}
$$

is plausible, and with what $C$.

3. **First-lobe ratio map.**  
   For sampled parameters, compute

$$
R^{(1)}_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\frac{|H(u_1)|}{T_{n,\alpha,\beta}}.
$$

Map its dependence on $n$, $\alpha$, and

$$
\theta=\frac{n+\alpha+1}{B}.
$$

4. **Laguerre cap face.**  
   Compute

$$
R_{n,\alpha}^{\mathrm{Lag,cap}}
=
\sup_{0\le u\le n}
\frac{|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|}
{\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4}},
$$

and separately the first-lobe value. The global $u\in[0,\infty)$ ratio is less relevant but may be useful for comparison.

5. **Finite-$B$ worst-case face.**  
   For fixed $(n,\alpha)$, scan the compactified parameter $\theta$. Determine whether the worst case is at the Laguerre face $\theta=0$, the finite low-$B$ face, or an interior $\theta$.

6. **Affine versus rational Liouville residuals.**  
   Derive and numerically evaluate the exact transformed residuals, including dependent-variable normalization. The comparison must use the actual Olver error functional, not only the principal product $K_B$.

7. **Prüfer amplitude integral.**  
   For the modified Prüfer variables

$$
H=\frac{r}{K_B^{1/4}}\sin\phi,
\qquad
p_BH'=rK_B^{1/4}\cos\phi,
$$

or a corrected regularized version, compute the exact amplitude equation and test whether the oscillatory integral gives real cancellation after the Airy layer.

8. **Schwarzian residual for dynamic mapping.**  
   Construct the variable-frequency map $\zeta(u)$ that matches the turning point and Bessel core. Compute its Schwarzian

$$
\{\zeta,u\}
=
\frac{\zeta'''}{\zeta'}-\frac32\left(\frac{\zeta''}{\zeta'}\right)^2
$$

on representative hard cases.

9. **Boundary cases.**  
   Directly verify or isolate separate proofs for

$$
n=0,\qquad \alpha=0,\qquad \beta=0,\qquad \alpha=\frac12,\qquad \beta=\frac12.
$$

10. **Semi-discrete target.**  
   Because the dispersive application only needs $\beta\in\mathbb N_0$, explicitly test $\beta=0,1,2,5,10$ and compare with large-$\beta$ behavior. The worst case may not be the Laguerre face.

Research strategy adjustment:

The next round should execute a controlled pivot.

First, make the first-lobe reduction fully formal and commit it to the lemma bank. This is now the most reliable certified progress. A1 and A3 should remove all ambiguity around the turning point, the no-critical-point case, and the degenerate boundary parameters.

Second, stop treating the rational coordinate as a solution. The rational coordinate is algebraically valuable, and the identity $v\widehat q_B=K_B$ should be retained. But Round 13 shows it is not an automatic way to beat Liouville-Green amplitude inflation.

Third, downgrade A2’s negative claims from “routes are impossible” to “naive versions are structurally obstructed.” This matters. A dynamic Bessel/Szegő method may still be the right analytic tool, but it must absorb the frequency drift rather than perturb around a constant frequency.

Fourth, split the amplitude problem into two disciplined tracks:

**Track A: Dynamic analytic track.**  
Build either a modified Prüfer/Airy theorem or a Szegő variable-frequency theorem. The goal is a large-$n$ theorem with explicit constants in the residual strip.

**Track B: Certified computational track.**  
Build the interval machinery now, but do not present it as proof until Track A gives a finite $N_0$ or the computation itself includes a rigorous infinite-family argument.

Fifth, keep the Laguerre cap as a boundary diagnostic, not as the main proof. The old global Laguerre target was too broad. The relevant tests are cap and first-lobe tests.

Next-round prompts by agent:

For A1:

You are A1, the broad strategist, proof synthesizer, and judge candidate. Your Round 14 task is to write the theorem-level first-lobe reduction in final form and begin the dynamic amplitude proof architecture.

Objectives:

1. State a complete right endpoint cap theorem with exact hypotheses:
   - $n\ge1$;
   - $\alpha>1/2$;
   - $\beta\ge0$;
   - $B=n+\alpha+\beta+1$;
   - $u=B(1-x)/2$;
   - central, energy, and small-exponent modules already clear their regions.

2. Prove the cap localization:
   - exact endpoint ODE;
   - $u_\sigma=nB/(B+n-1)\le n$;
   - $K_B$ quadratic and increasing on the cap;
   - sharpened $K_B'(u)\ge\alpha/2$.

3. Prove the forbidden-zone ascent lemma completely. Include:
   - Frobenius normalization;
   - positivity of $H$ near zero;
   - positivity and monotonicity of $W=p_BH'$;
   - no-zero and no-local-maximum conclusions;
   - the case where no turning point occurs inside the cap.

4. Prove the first-lobe reduction with no hidden limiting step:
   - if $u_1$ exists, any cap failure occurs at $u_1$;
   - if $u_1$ does not exist, the cap is controlled;
   - handle $q_B=0$ by an $\varepsilon$-argument or an Airy-layer statement.

5. Begin, but do not overclaim, one dynamic amplitude route. Choose either:
   - modified Prüfer variables with Airy matching;
   - Szegő/Liouville-Green variable-frequency transformation.

6. State exactly what theorem remains open after your reduction. Do not claim KKT is proved unless the first-lobe amplitude theorem is proved with constants.

Exploratory allocation:

Spend about 20% of your response comparing modified Prüfer and Szegő routes. Identify which one is more likely to produce explicit constants.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Include a section titled “Formal theorem statement for the lemma bank” and a section titled “What would falsify this route.”

For A2:

You are A2, the obstruction finder and referee-style strategist. Your Round 14 task is to convert your Round 13 obstruction analysis into precise, checkable theorems or calibrated warnings.

Objectives:

1. Derive the exact Liouville normal form in the affine $u$ coordinate, including:
   - dependent-variable transformation;
   - transformed potential;
   - Schwarzian or equivalent correction term;
   - exact residual relative to the proposed Bessel core.

2. Derive the exact Liouville normal form in the rational $v$ coordinate, including the same data. Confirm whether the residual error functional is identical, smaller, or merely reparameterized.

3. Prove or downgrade the constant-frequency Volterra blowup claim. If proving it, state a precise theorem on a parameter curve such as

$$
\alpha=cn,\qquad \beta=0,\qquad 0<c<1.
$$

Identify the exact residual integral and show its asymptotic order. If the exact residual does not grow like your model, report that.

4. Audit the Sonin handoff obstruction precisely. Distinguish:
   - impossible handoff at $q_B=0$;
   - possible handoff at $u_h>u_0$ with full derivative-energy bound;
   - Airy/Prüfer alternatives.

5. Construct the variable-frequency Szegő map candidate. Write the differential equation defining $\zeta(u)$ and derive the Schwarzian term that must be bounded.

6. State whether the rational coordinate has any remaining practical value for computation or symbolic simplification, even if it does not change the invariant product.

Exploratory allocation:

Spend about 20% on an alternative product-formula or Christoffel-kernel route, but only if you can state exact positivity or kernel inequalities that would imply the KKT target.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Separate “proved obstruction,” “strong heuristic warning,” and “open diagnostic.” Avoid declaring a route dead unless the proof covers all reasonable variants.

For A3:

You are A3, the algebra checker and endpoint-reduction auditor. Your Round 14 task is to produce lemma-bank-ready algebra, with no confusing intermediate false starts.

Objectives:

1. Write a clean proof of the affine endpoint ODE:

$$
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0.
$$

Explicitly show the chain-rule factors and the division by $B$.

2. Verify and record:
   - $p_B$;
   - $q_B$;
   - $K_B=p_Bq_B$;
   - $\Lambda_B$;
   - $\Delta_B$;
   - $u_\sigma$;
   - $K_B'(u_\sigma)$;
   - the sharpened lower bound $K_B'(u)\ge\alpha/2$.

3. Verify the degenerate cases:
   - $\alpha=\beta=0$;
   - $\alpha=0<\beta$;
   - $\alpha=1/2,\beta=0$;
   - $n=0$.

4. Write a clean proof of the rational-coordinate equation:

$$
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0,
$$

with

$$
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
$$

5. Prove

$$
v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v)).
$$

6. Audit A2’s claimed frequency drift identity

$$
\Lambda_\infty-\Lambda_B
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)(n+1)}{2B}.
$$

State exact definitions of $\Lambda_\infty$ and $\Lambda_B$ before proving or correcting it.

7. Audit the Bessel normalization

$$
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}.
$$

Attempt a first rigorous gamma-ratio inequality using a named inequality with stated hypotheses. If no useful bound follows, report the obstruction.

Exploratory allocation:

Spend about 20% checking whether a Christoffel-Darboux or Turán identity gives a pointwise bound at the first critical point. Do not overclaim; the deliverable is algebraic feasibility.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Include sections titled “Certified identities,” “Rejected identities,” and “Open analytic estimates.” Everything marked certified should be ready to paste into the lemma bank.

For A4:

You are A4, the technical lemma generator and symbolic/numeric check planner. Your Round 14 task is to build a reliable numerical map of the first-lobe problem and correct all unsupported constants.

Objectives:

1. Correctly enclose the first maximum of $J_{1/2}$. Use

$$
\tan t=2t
$$

and report a rigorous interval for both $t_1$ and $J_{1/2}(t_1)$. The target value is near

$$
0.6791921047.
$$

2. Investigate the full Bessel maximum

$$
B_*=\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|.
$$

Either cite a precise theorem with hypotheses or design an interval proof over $\nu$ and $t$. Do not assert monotonicity in $\nu$ without proof.

3. Compute high-precision maps of

$$
R_{n,\alpha}^{\mathrm{Lag,cap}}
=
\sup_{0\le u\le n}
\frac{|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|}
{\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4}}
$$

and separately the first-lobe ratio.

4. Compute finite-$B$ first-lobe ratios

$$
R_{n,\alpha,B}^{(1)}
=
\frac{|H(u_1)|}
{
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}
}
$$

over representative grids:
   - $1\le n\le200$;
   - $1/2\le\alpha\le\alpha_E(n)$;
   - $\beta=0,1,2,5,10,100,\infty$;
   - compactified $\theta=(n+\alpha+1)/B$.

5. Compute the gamma normalization

$$
M_{n,\alpha,B}
$$

on the same grids. Locate the maximum and test possible upper bounds such as

$$
M\le1+\frac{C}{n+1}.
$$

Report the smallest plausible $C$ observed, but do not call it proved.

6. Numerically evaluate the exact Liouville residuals supplied by A2 in both $u$ and $v$ coordinates. Compare their scaling for $\alpha=cn$, $\beta=0$.

7. Build the interval arithmetic plan but label it as a plan:
   - variables $(\alpha,\theta,u)$ for fixed $n$;
   - stable finite ${}_2F_1$ evaluation;
   - rigorous treatment of $\theta=0$ Laguerre face;
   - interval Newton isolation of critical points;
   - endpoint boxes;
   - dependency control for gamma ratios.

Exploratory allocation:

Spend about 20% testing the modified Prüfer amplitude integral numerically. Plot or tabulate whether oscillatory cancellation appears strong enough to support a large-$n$ theorem.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Separate “certified interval enclosures,” “high-precision experiments,” and “proof plans.” Do not state an $N_0$ unless it follows from a proved analytic inequality.

Confidence:

Confidence in the exact affine endpoint ODE: $0.95$.

Confidence in the cap length formula $u_\sigma\le n$: $0.99$.

Confidence in the quadratic product formula and cap monotonicity: $0.95$.

Confidence in the sharpened lower bound $K_B'(u)\ge\alpha/2$ on the residual cap: $0.90$.

Confidence in the forbidden-zone ascent lemma after polishing boundary cases: $0.85$.

Confidence in the first-lobe reduction after the turning-point limiting argument is written cleanly: $0.80$.

Confidence that Round 13 proves the first-lobe amplitude estimate: $0.10$.

Confidence that A4’s claimed gamma/Bessel/Olver closure is valid as written: $0.10$.

Confidence that naive constant-frequency Bessel comparison is too lossy in the $\alpha=O(n)$ strip: $0.75$.

Confidence that the rational coordinate is not an automatic amplitude fix: $0.90$.

Confidence that a dynamic Prüfer/Airy or Szegő/Liouville-Green route is the best analytic path for the next round: $0.60$.

Confidence that certified computation will eventually be useful once a large-$n$ threshold is obtained: $0.70$.

Overall confidence that the full real-parameter KKT conjecture is proved at this stage: $0.15$.

Overall confidence that the endpoint-cap first-lobe route is the best current strategy: $0.80$.

Overall judge decision:

Record Round 13 as a successful certification round for the endpoint-cap and first-lobe reduction, not as a closure round. Add the endpoint ODE, cap length, product monotonicity, sharpened derivative lower bound, forbidden-zone ascent, rational-coordinate ODE, and invariant product identity to the lemma bank with the statuses stated above. Do not add any Bessel maximum theorem, gamma-ratio bound, Olver error theorem, or interval verification as proved. Round 14 should be a disciplined amplitude round: A1 and A3 make the reduction airtight, A2 derives exact dynamic normal forms and residuals, and A4 maps the first-lobe ratios and constants without overclaiming.
