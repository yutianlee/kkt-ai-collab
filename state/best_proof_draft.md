# Best Proof Draft

No complete proof is currently certified.

## Conditional Architecture

1. Reduce by symmetry to the right endpoint.
2. Use central-region and energy estimates to remove the bulk of $[-1,1]$.
3. Write the remaining endpoint cap with $u=B(1-x)/2$, where $B=n+\alpha+\beta+1$.
4. Prove the exact endpoint ODE and a Sonin or comparison principle for the endpoint-normalized function.
5. Establish a sharp first-lobe Laguerre/Bessel certificate in the remaining strip.
6. Quantify the finite-$\beta$ bridge so the Jacobi endpoint cap inherits the certificate.
7. Mirror the argument at the left endpoint.

## What Would Count As A Proof

A complete proof must provide:

- exact parameter ranges for every reduction,
- a theorem-level endpoint certificate with explicit constants,
- a rigorous bridge between Laguerre and finite-$\beta$ Jacobi behavior,
- certified finite verification for any residual compact set,
- no appeal to non-effective asymptotics where the target constant is sharp.

## Current Status

Conditional only. The missing hard pieces are G1 and G2 in `state/gap_register.md`.
