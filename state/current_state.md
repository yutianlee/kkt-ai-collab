# Current State

## Problem Status

The full real-parameter KKT conjecture appears open. KKT prove the integer-parameter case through representation-theoretic unitarity, and nearby real-parameter Bernstein inequalities are known but do not give the sharp constant needed here.

The most useful working target is the one-real-one-integer case $\alpha\ge0$, $\beta\in\mathbb N_0$, because it is enough for the Laguerre dispersive application.

## Reliable Background

The existing local notes identify these comparatively reliable modules:

- central-region control away from endpoints,
- Sonin-Polya style localization to endpoint lobes,
- weighted energy estimates that cover part of parameter space,
- small endpoint exponent ranges such as $\alpha\le 1/2$ or the symmetric $\beta\le 1/2$,
- overflow confinement that limits where endpoint failure could occur.

These modules still need audit before being treated as theorem-level state.

## Active Obstruction

The remaining hard region is an endpoint cap. The strongest current synthesis says the decisive missing piece is an effective endpoint or Laguerre certificate with explicit constants, plus a rigorous finite-$\beta$ bridge back to Jacobi.

In the right endpoint normalization, prior notes introduce an endpoint variable of the form

$$
u=\frac{B(1-x)}{2},\qquad B=n+\alpha+\beta+1,
$$

and observe that the residual endpoint cap should satisfy $0\le u\le u_\sigma\le n$ after central-region clearance. This observation may remove the need for a global $u\in[0,\infty)$ Laguerre theorem, but it has not been fully certified.

## Normalized Workflow Start

The old KKT workflow used combined review-then-reason responses. The new workflow starts at round 12 and separates:

1. Stage A independent reasoning by A1/A2/A3/A4;
2. Stage B review of the other Stage A responses;
3. Stage C A1/GPT judge synthesis and next-round prompts for all four AIs.

Before Round 12, A1/GPT should first produce a bootstrap judge synthesis from `manifests/round_011_seed.md`. The result is stored in `manifests/round_011_bootstrap_judge.md` and becomes the clean starting decision for Round 12.

## Current Best Direction

Start the next round by auditing the endpoint-cap reduction rather than trying to prove the full conjecture at once:

1. verify the exact endpoint differential equation for the Jacobi-weighted function;
2. verify the central/endcap interface and the claim $u_\sigma\le n$;
3. identify the exact finite-$\beta$ bridge needed to compare Jacobi endpoint behavior with the Laguerre limit;
4. formulate the minimal Laguerre/Bessel first-lobe certificate that would close the remaining gap;
5. reject any proof that does not give explicit constants or a finite verification plan.
