## Current State

# Current State

## Problem Status

The full real-parameter KKT conjecture appears open. KKT prove the integer-parameter case through representation-theoretic unitarity, and nearby real-parameter Bernstein inequalities are known but do not give the sharp constant needed here.

The most useful working target is the one-real-one-integer case $\alpha\ge0$, $\beta\in\mathbb N_0$, because it is enough for the Laguerre dispersive application.

## Reliable Background

The existing local notes identify these comparatively reliable modules:

- central-region control away from endpoints,
- Sonin-Polya style localization to endpoint lobes,
- weighted energy estimates that cover part of parameter space,
- small endpoint exponent ranges such as $\alpha\le 1/2$ or the symmetric $\beta\le 1/2$,
- overflow confinement that limits where endpoint failure could occur.

These modules still need audit before being treated as theorem-level state.

## Active Obstruction

The remaining hard region is an endpoint cap. The strongest current synthesis says the decisive missing piece is an effective endpoint or Laguerre certificate with explicit constants, plus a rigorous finite-$\beta$ bridge back to Jacobi.

In the right endpoint normalization, prior notes introduce an endpoint variable of the form

```math
u=\frac{B(1-x)}{2},\qquad B=n+\alpha+\beta+1,
```

and observe that the residual endpoint cap should satisfy $0\le u\le u_\sigma\le n$ after central-region clearance. This observation may remove the need for a global $u\in[0,\infty)$ Laguerre theorem, but it has not been fully certified.

## Normalized Workflow Start

The old KKT workflow used combined review-then-reason responses. The new workflow starts at round 12 and separates:

1. Stage A independent reasoning by A1/A2/A3/A4;
2. Stage B review of the other Stage A responses;
3. Stage C A1/GPT judge synthesis and next-round prompts for all four AIs.

Before Round 12, A1/GPT should first produce a bootstrap judge synthesis from `manifests/round_011_seed.md`. The result is stored in `manifests/round_011_bootstrap_judge.md` and becomes the clean starting decision for Round 12.

## Current Best Direction

Start the next round by auditing the endpoint-cap reduction rather than trying to prove the full conjecture at once:

1. verify the exact endpoint differential equation for the Jacobi-weighted function;
2. verify the central/endcap interface and the claim $u_\sigma\le n$;
3. identify the exact finite-$\beta$ bridge needed to compare Jacobi endpoint behavior with the Laguerre limit;
4. formulate the minimal Laguerre/Bessel first-lobe certificate that would close the remaining gap;
5. reject any proof that does not give explicit constants or a finite verification plan.

Summary:

Input source acknowledged: :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Round 12 produced genuine progress, but not a proof of the real-parameter KKT conjecture.

The main certified advance is the endpoint-cap reduction. A1 derived it and A3 independently audited the algebra. In the right endpoint variable

```math
u=\frac{B(1-x)}{2},\qquad B=n+\alpha+\beta+1,
```

the post-central-contour residual cap satisfies

```math
0\le u\le u_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n
```

for $n\ge1$. In this cap the finite-$B$ endpoint equation is exactly

```math
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0,
```

with

```math
p_B(u)=u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right),
```

and

```math
q_B(u)
=
n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B}
-
\frac{\left(\left(1-\frac{n+1}{B}\right)u-\alpha\right)^2}
{4u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)}.
```

The product

```math
K_B(u)=p_B(u)q_B(u)
```

is a concave quadratic and is increasing on the residual cap. In the unresolved right-endpoint strip $\alpha\ge1/2$, one has the stronger lower bound

```math
K_B'(u)\ge K_B'(u_\sigma)
=
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2B}
\ge\frac14.
```

This gives a Sonin first-lobe reduction: the remaining endpoint maximum, if not already cleared by the central contour, energy estimate, or small-exponent theorem, is controlled by the first local extremum after the endpoint turning point. This replaces the older global Laguerre obstruction on $0\le u<\infty$ by a much smaller cap or first-lobe certificate on $0\le u\le n$.

The main unresolved issue is still an amplitude estimate for that first lobe, plus a finite-$B$ bridge. Round 12 also found several serious hazards in the proposed Bessel/Liouville-Green closure: the affine $u$-coordinate may introduce geometric amplitude inflation, naive Olver error integrals may grow when $\alpha=O(n)$, and A4’s quoted Bessel maximum $2/\pi$ is not the true maximum of $J_{1/2}$.

Selected main route:

Continue the endpoint-cap route, not the global Laguerre route.

The selected proof skeleton for Round 13 is:

1. Use the established global modules to reduce to a right endpoint residual cap:
   - central contour control on $|x|<\sigma$;
   - Sonin localization;
   - weighted-energy clearance;
   - small endpoint exponent theorem for $\alpha\le1/2$;
   - symmetry for the left endpoint.

2. In the residual right endpoint case $\alpha>1/2$, use the exact cap variable $u=B(1-x)/2$ and the monotone product $K_B=p_Bq_B$ to reduce the problem to the first allowed lobe.

3. Replace the older target

```math
|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|
\le
\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4},
\qquad 0\le u<\infty,
```

by the smaller cap target

```math
|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|
\le
\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4},
\qquad 0\le u\le n,
```

and preferably by the first-lobe version of this statement.

4. Develop a first-lobe amplitude certificate. The certificate may be:
   - a direct finite-$B$ Prüfer/Sonin comparison;
   - a rational-coordinate Bessel/Liouville-Green comparison;
   - a rigorous Laguerre cap certificate plus a finite-$B$ perturbation theorem;
   - or a hybrid analytic-plus-interval certificate, but only after an explicit large-$n$ analytic bound gives a finite $N_0$.

5. Treat computation as a certificate only after the analytic part gives compactness in all variables, including $n$ or an explicit large-$n$ theorem. An unbounded interval computation remains invalid.

Useful fragments by source:

A1:

A1 supplied the most important mathematical progress of the round.

The valuable certified fragments are:

1. The exact endpoint equation

```math
(p_BH_B')'+Q_BH_B=0
```

with

```math
p_B(u)=u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right),
```

and

```math
Q_B(u)
=
n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B}
-
\frac{\left(\left(1-\frac{n+1}{B}\right)u-\alpha\right)^2}
{4u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)}.
```

2. The exact central/endcap interface

```math
u_\sigma=\frac{B(1-\sigma)}{2}
=
\frac{nB}{B+n-1}
\le n.
```

3. The product monotonicity. With

```math
P_B(u)=p_B(u)Q_B(u),
```

one has $P_B''(u)\le0$ and

```math
P_B'(u_\sigma)
=
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(\alpha+n+1)}{2B}.
```

Thus $P_B'(u)\ge0$ on $0\le u\le u_\sigma$, and in the unresolved strip $\alpha\ge1/2$,

```math
P_B'(u)\ge\frac14.
```

4. The cap Sonin identity

```math
\left(
H^2+\frac{pH'^2}{Q}
\right)'
=
-\frac{(pQ)'H'^2}{Q^2},
```

which orders local extrema by amplitude inside the cap.

5. The observation that the old Laguerre target is overlarge. For the endpoint-cap proof, one only needs $0\le u\le n$, and then only the first lobe.

6. The finite-$B$ perturbation warning. A1 computed an explicit difference

```math
Q_B(u)=Q_\infty(u)+R_B(u),
```

and noted that $R_B$ changes sign. Therefore simple Sturm ordering between finite Jacobi and Laguerre endpoint equations is unavailable.

A2:

A2’s most valuable role was obstruction finding.

The useful fragments are:

1. A2 independently confirmed the cap interface and endpoint ODE.

2. A2 correctly emphasized that the affine $u$-coordinate is excellent for Sonin monotonicity but may be suboptimal for Liouville-Green amplitude estimates.

3. A2 proposed the rational endpoint coordinate

```math
v=B\frac{1-x}{1+x},
\qquad
x=\frac{B-v}{B+v}.
```

A direct calculation gives

```math
1-x^2=\frac{4Bv}{(B+v)^2},
\qquad
\frac{dx}{dv}=-\frac{2B}{(B+v)^2},
```

and the kinetic operator becomes

```math
\frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)\frac{d}{dx}\right)
=
\frac{(B+v)^2}{B}\frac{d}{dv}\left(v\frac{d}{dv}\right).
```

Thus, after multiplying by $B/(B+v)^2$, the equation has principal part

```math
(vH_v')'
```

and potential

```math
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
```

Equivalently, with $c_B=\kappa/B$,

```math
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{c_B}{(1+v/B)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v/B-\alpha)^2}{4v(1+v/B)^2}.
```

This rational-coordinate transform is algebraically correct and should be audited as a possible way to avoid the affine $u$ Liouville amplitude factor.

4. A2 correctly warned that a proof must handle the classically forbidden zone near $u=0$, where $q_B<0$ and the Sonin functional is not directly defined. The proposed “forbidden-zone ascent” argument is plausible but not certified.

Rejected or risky parts from A2:

A2’s claim that the rational coordinate “restores” the desired $O(1/n)$ residual is not proved. The coordinate removes one geometric amplitude factor, but it does not by itself bound the transformed potential error, Schwarzian terms, or Volterra integral. This should be treated as a proposed route, not as a closure.

A3:

A3 was the strongest algebra auditor.

The useful certified fragments are:

1. Independent verification of the endpoint ODE.

2. Independent verification of

```math
u_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n.
```

3. Independent verification of the quadratic form

```math
K_B(u)
=
-\frac{\alpha^2}{4}+\Lambda_Bu-\Delta_Bu^2,
```

where

```math
\Lambda_B=c_B+\frac{r_B\alpha}{2},
\qquad
\Delta_B=\frac{c_B}{B}+\frac{r_B^2}{4}.
```

4. The identity

```math
4\Delta_Bu_\sigma
=
n\left(1+\frac{n+1}{B}\right),
```

which gives the clean endpoint derivative formula.

5. The Frobenius coefficient near $u=0$:

```math
H(u)\sim A_{n,\alpha,B}u^{\alpha/2},
```

where

```math
A_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
B^{-\alpha/2}
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)}
{\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Gamma(n+1)}.
```

6. The Bessel model normalization

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
A_{n,\alpha,B}\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Lambda_B^{-\alpha/2}.
```

7. The critical-point equation

```math
\left(\beta(1-x)-\alpha(1+x)\right)P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)
+
(n+\alpha+\beta+1)(1-x^2)P_{n-1}^{(\alpha+1,\beta+1)}(x)
=
0.
```

Rejected or corrected part from A3:

A3 states in a remark that the lower bound $K_B'(u)\ge1/4$ works unconditionally for all $\alpha\ge0$. That is not correct in the fully degenerate case. For example, $\alpha=\beta=0$ gives $K_B'(u_\sigma)=0$. The certified lower bound $K_B'(u)\ge1/4$ should be recorded only for the residual right-endpoint range $\alpha\ge1/2$. This is sufficient, since $\alpha\le1/2$ is already covered by the small-endpoint theorem.

A4:

A4’s contribution is useful mainly as a technical planning and obstruction document, not as a proof.

Useful fragments:

1. A4 correctly identified that $M_{n,\alpha,B}\le1$ is false. For small $n$ and small $\alpha$, the Bessel normalization can exceed $1$, so the proof needs a gamma-ratio bound of the form

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}\le1+\frac{C_\Gamma}{n+1}
```

or a sharper structured replacement.

2. A4 correctly warned that the first Bessel peak may occur at $u_1=O(n)$ when $\alpha=O(n)$, so a naive Volterra or Olver error integral over the whole first lobe may not be $O(1/n)$.

3. A4’s interval-arithmetic compactification idea is useful once an analytic large-$n$ theorem exists. For fixed $n,\alpha$, the substitution

```math
\theta=\frac{n+\alpha+1}{B}
```

compactifies $\beta\in[0,\infty]$ to $\theta\in[0,1]$.

4. The finite polynomial representation

```math
P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}\left(1-\frac{2u}{B}\right)
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)_n}{n!}
{}_2F_1\left(-n,B;\alpha+1;\frac{u}{B}\right)
```

is the right starting point for interval verification.

Rejected or corrected parts from A4:

1. A4’s claim that

```math
\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|=\frac{2}{\pi}
```

is false. For $\nu=1/2$,

```math
J_{1/2}(t)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi t}}\sin t,
```

and its positive critical points satisfy

```math
\tan t=2t.
```

The first maximum occurs near

```math
t\approx1.1655611852,
```

with value approximately

```math
0.6791921047,
```

not $2/\pi\approx0.6366197724$. The weaker bound $<0.680$ may still be true, but it is a very tight statement and needs a precise theorem or certified numerical proof. It should not be marked as “fully certified” from the calculation A4 gave.

2. A4’s proposed Bessel-Sonin handoff is not yet valid. If the handoff point is not a local extremum, the Sonin functional contains a derivative term. One cannot replace the Sonin energy at the handoff point by $|H(u_{\mathrm{handoff}})|^2$ without bounding $pH'^2/q$. This is a substantive gap.

3. The statement that the large-$n$ closure has “ample room” is premature. The true Bessel maximum near $0.67919$ leaves less slack than A4 claimed, and the gamma and perturbation constants are not known.

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. Global Laguerre as the main target.

The global Laguerre inequality on $0\le u<\infty$ may be true or false, but it is no longer the minimal target for the Jacobi endpoint proof. Round 12 shows the endpoint cap only requires $0\le u\le n$, and then only the first lobe. Future work should not spend its main effort on global $u\in[0,\infty)$ unless it yields a cleaner proof.

2. Simple finite-$B$ Sturm comparison with Laguerre.

A1’s explicit formula for $R_B=Q_B-Q_\infty$ changes sign. Therefore any proof assuming $Q_B\ge Q_\infty$ or $Q_B\le Q_\infty$ uniformly on the cap should be rejected unless a restricted sign regime is explicitly proved.

3. Naive affine-coordinate Bessel perturbation.

A2’s amplitude-inflation warning and A4’s $u_1=O(n)$ scaling warning both show that a direct estimate

```math
H(u)=M_{n,\alpha,B}J_\alpha(2\sqrt{\Lambda_Bu})+O\left(\frac1n\right)
```

uniformly up to the first peak cannot be assumed. It must be derived with explicit constants and the correct coordinate/dependent-variable normalization.

4. A4’s Bessel maximum calculation.

The bound $<0.680$ may be usable, but the derivation via $2/\pi$ is wrong. The next round must replace it with a correct theorem or interval certificate.

5. Unexecuted interval arithmetic.

A finite verification is acceptable only after an explicit large-$n$ analytic theorem gives a finite $N_0$. Without such a theorem, interval arithmetic remains a plan, not a proof.

6. Overclaiming “certified” status for the first-lobe amplitude bound.

The cap localization is certified. The first-lobe amplitude estimate is not.

Known gaps:

G12.1: First-lobe amplitude certificate.

The central missing estimate is a theorem bounding the first local extremum of the endpoint-cap solution in the residual range

```math
n\ge1,\qquad
\frac12<\alpha<
\alpha_E(n):=\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)}{2n+3},
\qquad
\beta\ge0.
```

A minimal finite-$B$ statement would be:

Let $u_0$ be the cap turning point and $u_1$ the first critical point after $u_0$. Prove

```math
|H_B(u_1)|
\le
T_{n,\alpha,\beta}
=
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}.
```

G12.2: Correct coordinate for first-lobe comparison.

The affine coordinate $u$ is certified for localization, but may be inefficient for Liouville-Green amplitude estimates. The rational coordinate $v=B(1-x)/(1+x)$ has exact principal part $(vH_v')'$, but the transformed potential and error terms need a full audit.

G12.3: Gamma-ratio normalization.

The Bessel normalization

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
A_{n,\alpha,B}\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Lambda_B^{-\alpha/2}
```

can exceed $1$. A proof needs a sharp inequality for $M_{n,\alpha,B}$ in the residual strip. A bound of the form

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}\le1+\frac{C_\Gamma}{n+1}
```

is plausible but not proved.

G12.4: Bessel maximum.

A usable Bessel bound must be stated correctly. The candidate is probably

```math
\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|<0.680,
```

but the proof must not use the false value $2/\pi$. The next round should either cite a precise theorem with hypotheses or provide a rigorous interval proof of the maximum.

G12.5: Handoff derivative energy.

If a Bessel approximation is used only near the origin and then handed to Sonin monotonicity, the handoff must bound

```math
H(u_h)^2+\frac{p_B(u_h)H'(u_h)^2}{q_B(u_h)},
```

not only $|H(u_h)|$.

G12.6: Forbidden-zone ascent.

The endpoint solution should be shown to have no local maximum before the first turning point. The informal argument using positivity of $H$ and $(pH')'=-qH$ is plausible but needs a clean lemma with Frobenius initialization and sign preservation.

G12.7: Finite verification compactification.

The compactification $\theta=(n+\alpha+1)/B$ is useful, but the finite-dimensional domain is available only after a large-$n$ theorem. The $\beta=\infty$ face must be handled by analytic limiting formulas, not by numerically evaluating unstable $1^\infty$ expressions.

G12.8: Endpoint equality and strict margin.

The target becomes tight in several limiting regimes. The proof must identify where equality can occur and where strict margin remains. This matters for perturbation from Laguerre to finite $B$.

New lemmas to add:

### Lemma L12.1: Exact endpoint equation

For $n\ge0$, $\alpha,\beta\ge0$, $B=n+\alpha+\beta+1$, and

```math
H_B(u)=g_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}\left(1-\frac{2u}{B}\right),
```

one has

```math
(p_BH_B')'+q_BH_B=0,
```

where

```math
p_B(u)=u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)
```

and

```math
q_B(u)
=
n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B}
-
\frac{\left(\left(1-\frac{n+1}{B}\right)u-\alpha\right)^2}
{4u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)}.
```

Status: certified by A1 and A3.

### Lemma L12.2: Endpoint cap length

For $n\ge1$,

```math
u_\sigma
=
\frac{B(1-\sigma)}{2}
=
\frac{nB}{B+n-1}
\le n.
```

Status: certified by A1 and A3.

### Lemma L12.3: Endpoint product monotonicity

Let

```math
K_B(u)=p_B(u)q_B(u).
```

Then $K_B$ is a concave quadratic and

```math
K_B'(u_\sigma)
=
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2B}.
```

Thus $K_B'(u)\ge0$ for $0\le u\le u_\sigma$. In the residual right-endpoint range $\alpha\ge1/2$,

```math
K_B'(u)\ge\frac14.
```

Status: certified, with the range restriction $\alpha\ge1/2$ for the lower bound $1/4$.

### Lemma L12.4: Cap Sonin monotonicity

On any subinterval of the cap where $q_B>0$,

```math
S_B(u)=H_B(u)^2+\frac{p_B(u)H_B'(u)^2}{q_B(u)}
```

satisfies

```math
S_B'(u)
=
-\frac{K_B'(u)}{q_B(u)^2}H_B'(u)^2
\le0.
```

Consequently local extrema in the allowed portion of the cap are nonincreasing in amplitude as $u$ increases.

Status: certified conditional on $q_B>0$.

### Lemma L12.5: Forbidden-zone ascent

Assume $\alpha>0$ and right overflow. Let $u_0$ be the first zero of $K_B$ in the cap. Then $H_B$ has no local maximum on $0<u<u_0$.

A proof should use the regular Frobenius behavior

```math
H_B(u)\sim A_{n,\alpha,B}u^{\alpha/2},
\qquad A_{n,\alpha,B}>0,
```

and the sign of

```math
(p_BH_B')'=-q_BH_B
```

where $q_B<0$.

Status: plausible; not yet certified. Assign to A1/A3.

### Lemma L12.6: First-lobe reduction

Assume Lemma L12.5. In the residual right endpoint case, the cap maximum is attained at the first critical point $u_1$ after the cap turning point $u_0$.

Status: nearly certified after L12.5.

### Lemma L12.7: Laguerre cap limit

As $B\to\infty$ with $n,\alpha$ fixed,

```math
p_B(u)\to u,
```

and

```math
q_B(u)\to
q_\infty(u)
=
n+\frac{\alpha+1}{2}
-\frac{u}{4}
-\frac{\alpha^2}{4u}.
```

The limiting equation is the normalized Laguerre equation for

```math
\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)
=
\left(
\frac{\Gamma(n+1)}{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)}
\right)^{1/2}
u^{\alpha/2}e^{-u/2}L_n^{(\alpha)}(u).
```

On $0\le u\le n$,

```math
(uq_\infty(u))'
=
n+\frac{\alpha+1}{2}-\frac u2
\ge
\frac{n+\alpha+1}{2}
>0.
```

Status: certified.

### Lemma L12.8: Minimal Laguerre cap certificate

For $n\ge1$ and

```math
\frac12<\alpha<
\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)}{2n+3},
```

prove

```math
|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|
\le
\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4},
\qquad 0\le u\le n.
```

Better: prove it only at the first local maximum after the Laguerre cap turning point.

Status: proposed; not proved.

### Lemma L12.9: Rational-coordinate endpoint equation

Set

```math
v=B\frac{1-x}{1+x},
\qquad
x=\frac{B-v}{B+v}.
```

Then the endpoint equation becomes

```math
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0,
```

where

```math
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
```

Equivalently,

```math
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{c_B}{(1+v/B)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v/B-\alpha)^2}{4v(1+v/B)^2}.
```

Status: algebraically verified in this synthesis; its usefulness for amplitude estimates is open.

### Lemma L12.10: Correct Bessel maximum certificate

Prove or cite a theorem giving

```math
\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|<0.680.
```

The proof must account for the fact that

```math
\max_{t>0}J_{1/2}(t)\approx0.6791921047,
```

not $2/\pi$.

Status: needed; A4’s derivation is rejected.

### Lemma L12.11: Gamma-ratio bound for $M_{n,\alpha,B}$

Find explicit constants, or a sharper functional bound, for

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
A_{n,\alpha,B}\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Lambda_B^{-\alpha/2}
```

in the residual strip. A possible target is

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
\le
1+\frac{C_\Gamma}{n+1}.
```

Status: proposed; not proved.

### Lemma L12.12: Handoff Sonin energy bound

If using a Bessel approximation on $0<u\le u_h$, prove an upper bound for the full Sonin energy

```math
H_B(u_h)^2+\frac{p_B(u_h)H_B'(u_h)^2}{q_B(u_h)}.
```

Status: required if the Bessel-Sonin handoff route is pursued.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. Bessel maximum check.

Compute and rigorously enclose

```math
\max_{t>0}J_{1/2}(t),
```

where the maximizing point solves

```math
\tan t=2t.
```

Then verify whether the maximum over $\nu\ge1/2$ is indeed at $\nu=1/2$ or whether another order gives a larger value. This is a priority because A4’s $2/\pi$ computation is wrong.

2. Gamma normalization check.

For a grid and then by interval arithmetic, evaluate

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
A_{n,\alpha,B}\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Lambda_B^{-\alpha/2}
```

over

```math
1\le n\le 200,\qquad
\frac12\le\alpha\le\alpha_E(n),\qquad
\beta\in\{0,1,2,10,100,\infty\}.
```

Locate where $M>1$ and measure whether $M-1$ behaves like $O(1/n)$ or has a larger envelope.

3. Laguerre cap ratio.

Compute

```math
R_{n,\alpha}^{\mathrm{cap}}
=
\sup_{0\le u\le n}
\frac{
|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|
}{
\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4}
}
```

over the transition strip. Compare this with the global ratio on $0\le u<\infty$ to quantify how much the cap reduction buys.

4. First-lobe location.

For the Laguerre cap, compute the turning point $u_0$ and first critical point $u_1$. Test whether $u_1$ is $O(1)$, $O(\alpha^2/n)$, or $O(n)$ in the worst part of the strip. This determines whether a uniform first-lobe Bessel perturbation can plausibly be $O(1/n)$.

5. Finite-$B$ worst case.

For fixed $(n,\alpha)$, compute

```math
R_{n,\alpha,B}^{\mathrm{cap}}
=
\frac{
\sup_{0\le u\le u_\sigma}|H_B(u)|
}{
T_{n,\alpha,\beta}
}.
```

Test whether this ratio is monotone in $B$ or whether the worst case is finite. A nonmonotone finite-$B$ worst case would require a direct finite-$B$ certificate rather than a Laguerre bridge.

6. Rational versus affine coordinate.

Numerically compare Liouville-Green residual terms in $u$ and $v$ coordinates on identical parameter grids. Determine whether the rational coordinate actually reduces the Volterra integral, and by what asymptotic order.

7. Forbidden-zone ascent.

Verify that $H_B$ is strictly increasing from $u=0$ to the first turning point in representative hard cases, then prove it symbolically.

8. Endpoint equality cases.

Separate $n=0$, $\alpha=0$, $\beta=0$, and $\alpha=1/2$ boundary cases. Make sure no endpoint equality or degeneracy is being hidden inside an argument that assumes $q_B>0$ or $\alpha>0$.

Research strategy adjustment:

The next round should pivot from broad proof architecture to a narrow two-track certification program.

Track 1: certify the first-lobe reduction completely.

This means turning the cap monotonicity into a theorem-level statement with all endpoint and forbidden-zone cases handled. This is mainly A1/A3 work.

Track 2: decide which amplitude certificate is viable.

The old direct affine-coordinate Bessel certificate is now suspect. Round 13 should compare three candidate certificates:

1. Rational-coordinate Liouville-Green certificate using $v=B(1-x)/(1+x)$.

2. Prüfer/Sonin monotone-frequency certificate using the equation in a variable where the frequency product is increasing.

3. Laguerre cap certificate plus finite-$B$ bridge.

A4 should simultaneously build numerical tests to identify the most promising route and to search for finite-$B$ or Laguerre cap obstructions. Interval arithmetic should not yet be presented as a proof; it should be used to map the hard region and test candidate constants.

The highest priority is not to prove the whole conjecture in Round 13. The highest priority is to produce one fully explicit theorem of the following type:

For all $n\ge N_0$, $\frac12\le\alpha\le\alpha_E(n)$, and $\beta\ge0$, the first endpoint-cap maximum satisfies the KKT bound.

Only after that theorem exists should the panel assign finite interval verification for $1\le n<N_0$.

Next-round prompts by agent:

For A1:

You are A1, the broad strategist and proof synthesizer. Your Round 13 task is to turn the endpoint-cap localization into a theorem-level reduction and decide which amplitude route should become the main proof route.

Objectives:

1. State and prove a complete “right endpoint cap first-lobe reduction” theorem with exact hypotheses:
   - $n\ge1$;
   - $\alpha>1/2$ for the residual right endpoint;
   - $\beta\ge0$;
   - right overflow or noncentral residual;
   - $B=n+\alpha+\beta+1$;
   - $u=B(1-x)/2$;
   - $0\le u\le u_\sigma\le n$.

2. Include the exact endpoint ODE:

```math
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0,
```

with

```math
p_B(u)=u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right),
```

and

```math
q_B(u)
=
n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B}
-
\frac{\left(\left(1-\frac{n+1}{B}\right)u-\alpha\right)^2}
{4u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)}.
```

3. Prove the product monotonicity with the exact formula

```math
K_B'(u_\sigma)=\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2B},
```

and state precisely when this implies $K_B'(u)\ge1/4$.

4. Fill the forbidden-zone gap: prove that the regular solution has no local maximum before the first turning point. Use Frobenius data and the sign of $(p_BH')'=-q_BH$.

5. State the exact reduced first-lobe amplitude theorem needed to close KKT. Do not prove it unless you can provide explicit constants. The statement should use the first critical point $u_1$ after the endpoint turning point.

6. Compare the three amplitude routes:
   - affine $u$ Bessel;
   - rational $v$ Bessel;
   - Laguerre cap plus finite-$B$ bridge.

Give a concrete recommendation for which one should be primary in Round 14.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Label each claim as proved, plausible, or open. Include a section “What would falsify this route.”

For A2:

You are A2, the obstruction finder and referee-style strategist. Your Round 13 task is to rigorously audit the rational-coordinate proposal and the affine-coordinate amplitude-inflation objection.

Objectives:

1. Re-derive the rational-coordinate equation from scratch. With

```math
v=B\frac{1-x}{1+x},
\qquad
x=\frac{B-v}{B+v},
```

verify or correct the equation

```math
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0
```

and

```math
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
```

2. Relate $u$ and $v$ exactly:

```math
u=\frac{Bv}{B+v},
\qquad
v=\frac{Bu}{B-u}.
```

Find the image of the cap $0\le u\le u_\sigma$ in $v$ coordinates.

3. Test the claim that the rational coordinate eliminates the Liouville-Green amplitude inflation. This requires deriving the dependent-variable transform, not just the principal operator.

4. Compute the transformed potential’s Bessel-core expansion near $v=0$. Identify the analogues of $\Lambda_B$ and the perturbation remainder.

5. Determine whether the Volterra or Olver error integral in $v$ is plausibly $O(1/n)$ up to the first lobe when $\alpha=O(n)$. If not, identify the obstruction explicitly.

6. Audit A4’s Bessel-Sonin handoff idea. In particular, check whether controlling $|H(u_h)|$ alone is insufficient because the Sonin functional also contains $pH'^2/q$.

Required output:

Do not claim closure. Your deliverable is a referee report on whether the rational-coordinate amplitude route is viable, including formulas precise enough for A3 to algebra-check and for A4 to numerically test.

For A3:

You are A3, the algebra checker and endpoint-reduction auditor. Your Round 13 task is to certify or reject the exact algebra behind the two candidate endpoint coordinates and the first-lobe reduction.

Objectives:

1. Recheck the affine $u$ equation and record the final verified formulas for:
   - $p_B$;
   - $q_B$;
   - $K_B=p_Bq_B$;
   - $\Lambda_B$;
   - $\Delta_B$;
   - $u_\sigma$;
   - $K_B'(u_\sigma)$.

2. Correct the range statement for $K_B'(u)\ge1/4$. It is required only in the residual range $\alpha\ge1/2$. Check the degenerate cases $\alpha=\beta=0$, $\alpha=0<\beta$, and $\alpha=1/2,\beta=0$.

3. Prove or reject the forbidden-zone ascent lemma. Work directly from the Frobenius expansion and

```math
(p_BH')'=-q_BH.
```

Be precise about positivity of $H$, behavior of $p_BH'$, and whether a zero or local maximum can occur before the turning point.

4. Algebraically verify the rational-coordinate equation:

```math
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0.
```

Check A2’s formula for $\widehat q_B(v)$ and give a simplified expression for the product

```math
\widehat K_B(v)=v\widehat q_B(v).
```

5. Determine whether $\widehat K_B(v)$ has useful monotonicity on the transformed cap. Compare it with the affine $K_B(u)$ monotonicity.

6. Recheck A4’s Bessel normalization formula and derive the exact expression for $M_{n,\alpha,B}$ in both $u$ and $v$ coordinates. State whether the normalizations agree at leading order.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Include “certified identities,” “rejected identities,” and “open analytic estimates.” Provide enough algebra for direct inclusion in the lemma bank.

For A4:

You are A4, the technical lemma generator and symbolic/numeric check planner. Your Round 13 task is to build a reliable numerical and analytic test harness for the first-lobe certificate, while correcting the Bessel maximum issue.

Objectives:

1. Correct the Bessel maximum claim. For $\nu=1/2$,

```math
J_{1/2}(t)=\sqrt{\frac{2}{\pi t}}\sin t,
```

and the first positive maximum solves

```math
\tan t=2t.
```

Compute a rigorous interval enclosure for the maximizer and maximum. Then investigate whether

```math
\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|<0.680
```

is a known theorem or requires interval proof. Do not use $2/\pi$ as the maximum.

2. Build a high-precision numerical map of the Laguerre cap ratio

```math
R_{n,\alpha}^{\mathrm{cap}}
=
\sup_{0\le u\le n}
\frac{
|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|
}{
\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4}
}
```

for $1\le n\le200$ and $\frac12\le\alpha\le\alpha_E(n)$. Track the first-lobe maximum separately from the cap maximum.

3. Build the analogous finite-$B$ cap ratio

```math
R_{n,\alpha,B}^{\mathrm{cap}}
=
\frac{
\sup_{0\le u\le u_\sigma}|H_B(u)|
}{
T_{n,\alpha,\beta}
}
```

for sample $\beta$ values and for compactified $\theta=(n+\alpha+1)/B$.

4. Numerically compare affine $u$ and rational $v$ perturbation sizes. For each parameter sample, compute the Bessel-core residual in both coordinates and estimate the relevant Volterra integral.

5. Test the gamma normalization

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
A_{n,\alpha,B}\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Lambda_B^{-\alpha/2}.
```

Find the maximum of $M-1$ over sampled grids and test whether $M\le1+C/(n+1)$ is plausible with a moderate explicit $C$.

6. Design, but do not yet claim, an interval arithmetic proof plan. It must include:
   - variables $(\alpha,\theta,u)$ for fixed $n$;
   - stable evaluation of the finite hypergeometric polynomial;
   - separate treatment of the $\theta=0$ Laguerre face;
   - interval Newton isolation of critical points;
   - a path to a finite $N_0$ only after A1/A2/A3 provide a large-$n$ theorem.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Include numerical tables or precise sampled findings if available. Separate experimental evidence from certified interval bounds.

Confidence:

Confidence in the new endpoint-cap algebra: high, about $0.90$.

Confidence in the first-lobe reduction after the forbidden-zone lemma is written cleanly: moderate-high, about $0.75$.

Confidence that the current Round 12 material already proves KKT: low, about $0.15$.

Confidence that the endpoint-cap route is the best current strategy: moderate-high, about $0.80$.

Confidence that the rational-coordinate Liouville-Green route will close the first-lobe amplitude estimate: uncertain, about $0.45$.

Confidence that a hybrid analytic-plus-certified-computation route can eventually close the semi-discrete case $\alpha\ge0$, $\beta\in\mathbb N_0$: moderate, about $0.60$.

Overall judge decision:

Round 12 should be recorded as a successful reduction round, not a closure round. Add the endpoint ODE, cap length, product monotonicity, and cap Sonin first-lobe reduction to the lemma bank as certified or nearly certified modules. Do not add any Bessel perturbation theorem, Bessel maximum constant, gamma-ratio bound, or interval verification as proved. The next round should focus on making the first-lobe reduction theorem airtight and deciding whether the rational-coordinate amplitude route or Laguerre-cap bridge is analytically viable.

## Round 13 Update

Timestamp: 2026-06-02 18:36:11

See `rounds/kkt-main/round_013/judge/judge.md`.

Summary:

Input source acknowledged: :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}

Round 13 is a successful reduction-and-audit round, not a proof round. The real-parameter KKT conjecture is still not closed by the material in this round. The strongest certified progress is that the endpoint-cap localization has now been upgraded to a theorem-level reduction, modulo small boundary-case bookkeeping. In particular, the right endpoint residual problem in the variable

```math
u=\frac{B(1-x)}{2},\qquad B=n+\alpha+\beta+1,
```

is confined to

```math
0\le u\le u_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n
```

for $n\ge1$, and the finite-$B$ endpoint equation

```math
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0
```

has a monotone Sonin product

```math
K_B(u)=p_B(u)q_B(u).
```

The forbidden-zone ascent lemma is now essentially proved: for $\alpha>0$, the regular endpoint solution is positive and increasing before the first zero of $q_B$ or $K_B$. Therefore there is no pre-turning-point local maximum. Combined with Sonin monotonicity on the allowed side, this gives the main Round 13 reduction: any remaining endpoint-cap failure must occur at the first critical point after the first turning point.

The amplitude certificate is still open. Round 13 gives strong evidence that the naive constant-frequency Bessel approximation, the rational-coordinate “amplitude-fix” hope, and the direct Laguerre-to-finite-$B$ perturbation bridge are too crude in the $\alpha=O(n)$ transition strip. These are not all formally disproved as mathematical possibilities, but they should no longer be the main proof route in their naive forms. The next round should focus on a dynamic first-lobe amplitude theorem: either a regularized Prüfer/Airy argument or a fully variable-frequency Szegő/Liouville-Green transformation with explicit constants. A4 should simultaneously build a numerical test harness, but interval arithmetic remains a proof only after a large-$n$ analytic reduction is available.

Selected main route:

The selected route for Round 14 is:

**Endpoint-cap first-lobe route with dynamic amplitude control.**

The proof skeleton should now be:

1. Use the existing global modules to reduce to the right endpoint residual cap:
   - central contour clearance;
   - weighted-energy clearance;
   - small right-endpoint exponent theorem for $0\le\alpha\le1/2$;
   - symmetry for the left endpoint;
   - separate base cases $n=0$, $\alpha=0$, $\beta=0$, and the boundary $\alpha=1/2$.

2. In the residual right endpoint range,

```math
n\ge1,\qquad \alpha>1/2,\qquad \beta\ge0,
```

set

```math
B=n+\alpha+\beta+1,\qquad H(u)=g_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}\left(1-\frac{2u}{B}\right).
```

3. Use the exact endpoint equation

```math
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0,
```

where

```math
p_B(u)=u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)
```

and

```math
q_B(u)
=
n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B}
-
\frac{\left(\left(1-\frac{n+1}{B}\right)u-\alpha\right)^2}
{4u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)}.
```

4. Use the cap bound

```math
0\le u\le u_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n.
```

5. Use the product identity

```math
K_B(u)=p_B(u)q_B(u)
=
-\frac{\alpha^2}{4}+\Lambda_Bu-\Delta_Bu^2,
```

where

```math
r_B=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{B}=1-\frac{n+1}{B},
```

```math
c_B=n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B},
```

```math
\Lambda_B=c_B+\frac{\alpha r_B}{2},
\qquad
\Delta_B=\frac{c_B}{B}+\frac{r_B^2}{4}.
```

Then $K_B$ is concave, and

```math
K_B'(u_\sigma)
=
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2B}.
```

Moreover, because

```math
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2(n+\alpha+\beta+1)}
\ge \frac{\alpha}{2},
```

one has the sharpened cap lower bound

```math
K_B'(u)\ge K_B'(u_\sigma)\ge\frac{\alpha}{2}\ge\frac14
```

throughout the residual right endpoint range $\alpha\ge1/2$.

6. Prove and record the forbidden-zone ascent lemma. If $u_0$ is the first zero of $q_B$ or equivalently $K_B$ in the cap, then on $(0,u_0)$ one has $q_B<0$, while the regular Frobenius branch satisfies

```math
H(u)\sim A_{n,\alpha,B}u^{\alpha/2},\qquad A_{n,\alpha,B}>0.
```

With

```math
W(u)=p_B(u)H'(u),
```

the ODE gives

```math
W'(u)=-q_B(u)H(u)>0
```

as long as $H>0$ and $q_B<0$. Since $H>0$ and $W>0$ near zero, the solution remains positive and increasing up to $u_0$. Therefore there is no local maximum in the forbidden zone.

7. On the allowed side $q_B>0$, use the cap Sonin functional

```math
S_B(u)=H(u)^2+\frac{p_B(u)H'(u)^2}{q_B(u)}.
```

It satisfies

```math
S_B'(u)
=
-\frac{K_B'(u)}{q_B(u)^2}H'(u)^2\le0.
```

Thus local extrema in the allowed portion of the cap are nonincreasing in amplitude as $u$ increases from the endpoint toward the central boundary.

8. Conclude the first-lobe reduction. Let $u_1$ be the first critical point of $H$ after $u_0$, if it exists. Then the residual endpoint cap is controlled once one proves

```math
|H(u_1)|
\le
T_{n,\alpha,\beta}
=
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}.
```

If no such $u_1$ exists, the cap maximum lies at the central boundary already controlled by the central module, or is controlled by monotonicity from the endpoint.

The remaining proof problem is exactly this first-critical-point amplitude estimate. Round 14 should no longer treat the global Laguerre inequality on $0\le u<\infty$ as the primary target. The Laguerre cap and the $\beta=\infty$ face remain essential diagnostics, but the selected main route is a finite-$B$ first-lobe theorem.

Useful fragments by source:

### A1

A1 supplied the cleanest theorem-level synthesis of the endpoint-cap reduction.

Useful fragments:

1. A1 stated the exact finite-$B$ endpoint equation in the right endpoint variable and kept the normalization consistent with the KKT target.

2. A1 gave the cap length identity

```math
u_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n.
```

This remains one of the main advances of the recent rounds because it eliminates the need to prove a global Laguerre bound on $0\le u<\infty$.

3. A1 formulated the first-lobe reduction precisely: the remaining cap estimate reduces to bounding the first critical point after the first turning point.

4. A1 gave a convincing sign-based proof of forbidden-zone ascent. This was the most important qualitative addition of Round 13, because previous Sonin arguments only applied where $q_B>0$.

5. A1 correctly did not claim an amplitude theorem. A1’s conclusion that the endpoint-cap route is still the best strategy is adopted.

Corrections or cautions:

A1’s recommendation of a direct finite-$B$ Prüfer/Sonin route is reasonable, but it needs an Airy-layer or modified Prüfer initialization at the turning point. Standard Prüfer variables are singular when $K_B(u_0)=0$. The next round must not skip this issue.

### A2

A2’s most valuable contribution was obstruction analysis.

Useful fragments:

1. A2 re-derived the rational endpoint coordinate

```math
v=B\frac{1-x}{1+x},
\qquad
x=\frac{B-v}{B+v},
```

with

```math
u=\frac{Bv}{B+v},
\qquad
v=\frac{Bu}{B-u}.
```

The cap maps to

```math
0\le v\le v_\sigma=\frac{nB}{B-1}.
```

2. A2 verified the rational-coordinate equation

```math
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0,
```

with

```math
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
```

3. A2 emphasized the key invariant identity

```math
\widehat K_B(v):=v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v)).
```

This means the rational coordinate preserves the Sonin invariant product rather than creating a new monotonicity or amplitude mechanism. The rational coordinate may still be useful for stable computation or for a cleaner normal form, but it is not a “free” Liouville-Green amplitude fix.

4. A2 correctly warned that constant-frequency Bessel approximations are likely too lossy in the $\alpha=O(n)$ transition strip. The Volterra scaling argument is a serious obstruction search.

5. A2 correctly warned that a Sonin handoff at or near the turning point is invalid unless the derivative-energy term is controlled. The functional

```math
H^2+\frac{p_BH'^2}{q_B}
```

has a pole as $q_B\to0^+$ unless the derivative term is handled.

6. A2’s finite-$B$ versus Laguerre frequency drift warning is important. The identity

```math
\Lambda_\infty-\Lambda_B
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)(n+1)}{2B}
```

shows that direct finite-$B$ perturbation from the Laguerre face is not uniformly small in the semi-discrete regime $\beta=0$, especially when $\alpha=O(n)$.

Corrections or cautions:

A2 overstates several negative conclusions. The round should record these as warnings, not impossibility theorems. A model Volterra integral with $O(n)$ growth does not by itself rule out every Bessel-based method, every renormalized Bessel comparison, or a dynamic Liouville-Green construction. It does reject the naive constant-frequency route unless someone supplies a sharper transformed error with explicit constants.

### A3

A3 was the strongest algebra auditor.

Useful fragments:

1. A3 independently verified the affine endpoint equation, the cap length, and the quadratic product structure.

2. A3 sharpened the monotonicity estimate to

```math
K_B'(u)\ge\frac{\alpha}{2}
```

on the cap, hence

```math
K_B'(u)\ge\frac14
```

in the residual right-endpoint strip $\alpha\ge1/2$.

3. A3 verified the rational-coordinate equation and the invariant identity

```math
v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v)).
```

4. A3 supplied the Frobenius coefficient

```math
A_{n,\alpha,B}
=
B^{-\alpha/2}
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)}
{\Gamma(\alpha+1)\Gamma(n+1)}
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}.
```

Equivalently,

```math
A_{n,\alpha,B}
=
B^{-\alpha/2}
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
\frac{1}{\Gamma(\alpha+1)}
```

after simplification in the Bessel-matching form.

5. A3 re-derived the Bessel model normalization

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}.
```

This algebraic expression is accepted; estimates for it remain open.

Corrections or cautions:

A3’s detailed derivation of the endpoint ODE contains a false start involving a missing factor. The final formulas are correct, but the lemma-bank version should be rewritten cleanly. The correct transformation should explicitly show that

```math
\frac{d}{dx}\left((1-x^2)g_x\right)=B(p_BH')'
```

and

```math
\frac{F}{1-x^2}
=
\kappa
-
B\frac{(r_Bu-\alpha)^2}{4u(1-u/B)},
```

so that dividing the full equation by $B$ gives the accepted $q_B$.

### A4

A4 was useful mainly as a numerical and certificate planner.

Useful fragments:

1. A4 correctly centered attention on the Bessel maximum

```math
B_*=\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|
```

and the gamma/Bessel normalization $M_{n,\alpha,B}$.

2. A4 correctly rejected the older false value $2/\pi$ as the maximum for $J_{1/2}$.

3. A4 gave the right critical equation for the first positive maximum of $J_{1/2}$:

```math
\tan t=2t.
```

The first solution is approximately

```math
t_1\approx1.1655611852072113,
```

and

```math
J_{1/2}(t_1)\approx0.6791921047.
```

A4’s reported value $0.67918418$ is slightly inaccurate, but the qualitative correction is right.

4. A4 gave a useful compactified interval-arithmetic plan using

```math
\theta=\frac{n+\alpha+1}{B}.
```

For fixed $n$, this compactifies the finite-$B$ and Laguerre boundary faces into

```math
0\le\theta\le1.
```

5. A4’s proposed use of the finite hypergeometric representation

```math
P_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}\left(1-\frac{2u}{B}\right)
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)_n}{n!}
{}_2F_1\left(-n,B;\alpha+1;\frac{u}{B}\right)
```

is the right basis for stable interval evaluation.

Corrections or cautions:

A4’s claimed closure is rejected. The claims

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}\le1+\frac{1}{4n}
```

and

```math
|H(u_1)|\le M_{n,\alpha,B}B_*+\mathrm{Error}
```

are not proved. The assertion that the Olver error is “trivially” below the remaining slack is not acceptable. A4 also cited the monotonicity of the Bessel maximum in $\nu$ without proving it or stating a precise theorem with hypotheses. The next round should turn these into computations or citations, not proof claims.

Rejected or risky ideas:

1. **Claiming Round 13 proves KKT.**
   Rejected. Round 13 proves no first-lobe amplitude theorem and no finite-$B$ bridge theorem with constants. The conjecture remains open in this workflow.

2. **Global Laguerre as the main proof target.**
   Risky and no longer minimal. The cap restriction $0\le u\le n$ and the first-lobe reduction are strictly sharper. The Laguerre face remains a diagnostic and possible boundary component for interval arithmetic, but not the primary analytic target.

3. **Naive constant-frequency Bessel perturbation.**
   Rejected as a main route unless re-derived with an exact dependent-variable transform and a bounded error functional. A2’s scaling analysis strongly suggests the error can grow in the $\alpha=O(n)$ region.

4. **Rational coordinate as an automatic amplitude fix.**
   Rejected. The identity

```math
v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v))
```

shows the rational coordinate preserves the same Sonin invariant product. It may help algebra or numerics, but it does not by itself remove WKB amplitude issues.

5. **Naive Laguerre-to-finite-$B$ perturbation.**
   Rejected for the semi-discrete target. The finite-$B$ frequency may differ from the Laguerre limit by $O(n)$ when $\beta$ is small, especially when $\alpha=O(n)$. Any bridge must either be localized with strict margins or replaced by a direct finite-$B$ theorem.

6. **Sonin handoff at the turning point.**
   Rejected. Since $q_B(u_0)=0$, the derivative-energy term in

```math
H^2+\frac{p_BH'^2}{q_B}
```

cannot be ignored. Handoff must occur away from the turning point, with a full derivative-energy bound, or through an Airy/Prüfer regularization.

7. **A4’s Bessel maximum certificate as written.**
   Not certified. The value for $J_{1/2}$ should be corrected to approximately $0.6791921047$, and the supremum over all $\nu\ge1/2$ requires a named theorem or interval proof.

8. **A4’s gamma-ratio bound as written.**
   Not certified. Stirling heuristics are insufficient. The bound may be true in some form, but it needs explicit inequalities such as Binet, Gautschi, Kershaw, or Robbins bounds with tracked remainders.

9. **Unbounded or premature interval arithmetic.**
   Interval arithmetic is valid only after a large-$n$ analytic theorem gives a finite $N_0$, or after the computation includes a fully rigorous infinite-family argument. A grid over many $n$ is not a proof by itself.

Known gaps:

### G13.1: First-lobe amplitude theorem

The central open theorem is:

For

```math
n\ge1,\qquad \frac12<\alpha<\alpha_E(n):=\frac{(2n+1)(n+1)}{2n+3},\qquad \beta\ge0,
```

let $u_1$ be the first critical point after the first endpoint turning point in the cap. Prove

```math
|H(u_1)|
\le
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}.
```

This is the main open gap.

### G13.2: Turning-point regularization

The forbidden-zone ascent is essentially proved, and Sonin monotonicity is clear where $q_B>0$. What remains is a polished bridge through the turning point. The proof should handle:

- no zero of $q_B$ in the cap;
- zero of $q_B$ at the cap boundary;
- first critical point absent;
- limiting application of Sonin monotonicity on $[u_0+\varepsilon,u_\sigma]$;
- Airy or modified Prüfer initialization if a dynamic amplitude proof starts at $u_0$.

### G13.3: Exact dynamic amplitude mechanism

The next proof must produce one of the following with explicit constants:

1. A modified Prüfer amplitude theorem through the first lobe, with controlled Airy-layer matching.

2. A Szegő/Liouville-Green transformation that absorbs the quadratic drift and leaves a Schwarzian residual whose integral is explicitly bounded.

3. A direct finite-$B$ comparison theorem not relying on constant-frequency Bessel approximation.

### G13.4: Actual Liouville-Green residual in $u$ and $v$

The panel needs the exact transformed normal forms, including dependent-variable normalization and Schwarzian terms. It is not enough to compare principal operators.

### G13.5: Bessel maximum theorem

A usable bound should be something like

```math
\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|<0.680,
```

but this must be proved or cited precisely. The $\nu=1/2$ computation alone is not enough unless one proves the supremum over $\nu$ occurs there.

### G13.6: Gamma-ratio normalization

For the Bessel route, one needs a certified bound on

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}.
```

The proposed $1+O(1/n)$ bound is plausible near small $\alpha$ but not proved. The $\alpha=O(n)$ region should be studied separately because there may be exponential decay, but the transition between these regimes must be controlled.

### G13.7: Finite verification compactification

The compactified variables

```math
(\alpha,\theta,u),\qquad \theta=\frac{n+\alpha+1}{B},
```

are useful. However, rigorous interval verification requires:

- a finite $N_0$ from analytic theory;
- stable treatment of the $\theta=0$ Laguerre face;
- interval Newton or subresultant isolation of critical points;
- exact treatment of endpoint and no-critical-point cases.

### G13.8: Boundary and equality cases

The following must be separated:

```math
n=0,\qquad \alpha=0,\qquad \beta=0,\qquad \alpha=\frac12,\qquad \beta=\frac12.
```

The endpoint-reduction theorem assumes $\alpha>0$ for Frobenius ascent and $\alpha\ge1/2$ for the sharpened derivative lower bound. These edge cases must not be hidden inside generic statements.

New lemmas to add:

### Lemma L13.1: Exact affine endpoint equation

For $n\ge0$, $\alpha,\beta\ge0$, $B=n+\alpha+\beta+1$, and

```math
H(u)=g_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}\left(1-\frac{2u}{B}\right),
```

one has

```math
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0,
```

where

```math
p_B(u)=u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)
```

and

```math
q_B(u)
=
n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B}
-
\frac{\left(\left(1-\frac{n+1}{B}\right)u-\alpha\right)^2}
{4u\left(1-\frac{u}{B}\right)}.
```

Status: certified. Add with a clean chain-rule proof.

### Lemma L13.2: Endpoint cap length

With

```math
\sigma=\frac{\alpha+\beta}{\alpha+\beta+2n},
```

one has

```math
u_\sigma=\frac{B(1-\sigma)}{2}
=
\frac{nB}{B+n-1}\le n
```

for $n\ge1$.

Status: certified.

### Lemma L13.3: Quadratic product and sharpened monotonicity

Let

```math
K_B(u)=p_B(u)q_B(u).
```

Then

```math
K_B(u)
=
-\frac{\alpha^2}{4}+\Lambda_Bu-\Delta_Bu^2,
```

where

```math
\Lambda_B=c_B+\frac{\alpha r_B}{2},
\qquad
\Delta_B=\frac{c_B}{B}+\frac{r_B^2}{4},
```

with

```math
c_B=n+\frac12-\frac{n+1}{2B},
\qquad
r_B=1-\frac{n+1}{B}.
```

Moreover, $K_B$ is concave and

```math
K_B'(u_\sigma)
=
\frac{(\alpha+\beta)(n+\alpha+1)}{2B}.
```

Therefore, on $0\le u\le u_\sigma$,

```math
K_B'(u)\ge K_B'(u_\sigma)\ge\frac{\alpha}{2}.
```

In the residual strip $\alpha\ge1/2$,

```math
K_B'(u)\ge\frac14.
```

Status: certified.

### Lemma L13.4: Forbidden-zone ascent

Assume $\alpha>0$. Let $u_0$ be the first zero of $q_B$, equivalently $K_B$, in the cap. Then the regular endpoint solution $H$ is positive and strictly increasing on $(0,u_0)$.

Proof skeleton: use

```math
H(u)\sim A_{n,\alpha,B}u^{\alpha/2},\qquad A_{n,\alpha,B}>0,
```

and

```math
(p_BH')'=-q_BH.
```

Since $q_B<0$ on $(0,u_0)$ and $p_BH'>0$ near zero, $p_BH'$ stays positive and increasing, so $H'>0$.

Status: essentially certified; add exact treatment if no $u_0$ exists in the cap.

### Lemma L13.5: Cap Sonin monotonicity

On every subinterval where $q_B>0$,

```math
S_B(u)=H(u)^2+\frac{p_B(u)H'(u)^2}{q_B(u)}
```

satisfies

```math
S_B'(u)
=
-\frac{K_B'(u)}{q_B(u)^2}H'(u)^2\le0.
```

Status: certified.

### Lemma L13.6: First-lobe reduction

Assume the global modules reduce the proof to the right endpoint cap in the residual range $n\ge1$, $\alpha>1/2$, $\beta\ge0$. If $u_1$ is the first critical point after the first turning point $u_0$, then any failure of the cap estimate occurs at $u_1$. Hence it is enough to prove

```math
|H(u_1)|
\le
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}.
```

If no $u_1$ exists, the cap is controlled by ascent plus central boundary control.

Status: nearly certified; requires boundary-case bookkeeping and a small limiting argument near $q_B=0$.

### Lemma L13.7: Rational-coordinate endpoint equation and invariant product

Set

```math
v=B\frac{1-x}{1+x},
\qquad
x=\frac{B-v}{B+v}.
```

Then

```math
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0,
```

where

```math
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
```

The variables satisfy

```math
u=\frac{Bv}{B+v},
\qquad
v=\frac{Bu}{B-u},
```

and

```math
v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v)).
```

Status: certified. This should be recorded as an algebraic identity, not as an amplitude theorem.

### Lemma L13.8: Bessel normalization formula

For the Bessel model

```math
J_\alpha(2\sqrt{\Lambda_Bu}),
```

the endpoint matching constant is

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}.
```

Status: certified algebraically. No upper bound for $M_{n,\alpha,B}$ is certified yet.

### Warning W13.1: Naive constant-frequency Volterra risk

In the $\alpha=O(n)$ transition strip, constant-frequency Bessel perturbation appears to have a large error integral. This is a serious obstruction, but should be recorded as a warning until the exact Liouville normal form and residual are derived.

Status: warning, not theorem.

### Warning W13.2: Naive Laguerre bridge risk

The finite-$B$ frequency can differ from the Laguerre limiting frequency by

```math
\Lambda_\infty-\Lambda_B
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)(n+1)}{2B},
```

which is not uniformly small when $\beta$ is small and $\alpha=O(n)$.

Status: warning/theorem depending on the exact definitions of $\Lambda_\infty$ and $\Lambda_B$; A3 should audit before recording.

Counterexample checks to run:

1. **Bessel maximum certificate.**
   Rigorously enclose the first maximum of $J_{1/2}$ using

```math
\tan t=2t,
```

and then prove or disprove that

```math
\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|
```

is attained at $\nu=1/2$. If no theorem is cited, run an interval proof over $\nu$ and $t$.

2. **Gamma normalization envelope.**
   Compute

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}
```

over the residual strip. Track the maximum of $M-1$ and test whether a bound like

```math
M\le1+\frac{C}{n+1}
```

is plausible, and with what $C$.

3. **First-lobe ratio map.**
   For sampled parameters, compute

```math
R^{(1)}_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\frac{|H(u_1)|}{T_{n,\alpha,\beta}}.
```

Map its dependence on $n$, $\alpha$, and

```math
\theta=\frac{n+\alpha+1}{B}.
```

4. **Laguerre cap face.**
   Compute

```math
R_{n,\alpha}^{\mathrm{Lag,cap}}
=
\sup_{0\le u\le n}
\frac{|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|}
{\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4}},
```

and separately the first-lobe value. The global $u\in[0,\infty)$ ratio is less relevant but may be useful for comparison.

5. **Finite-$B$ worst-case face.**
   For fixed $(n,\alpha)$, scan the compactified parameter $\theta$. Determine whether the worst case is at the Laguerre face $\theta=0$, the finite low-$B$ face, or an interior $\theta$.

6. **Affine versus rational Liouville residuals.**
   Derive and numerically evaluate the exact transformed residuals, including dependent-variable normalization. The comparison must use the actual Olver error functional, not only the principal product $K_B$.

7. **Prüfer amplitude integral.**
   For the modified Prüfer variables

```math
H=\frac{r}{K_B^{1/4}}\sin\phi,
\qquad
p_BH'=rK_B^{1/4}\cos\phi,
```

or a corrected regularized version, compute the exact amplitude equation and test whether the oscillatory integral gives real cancellation after the Airy layer.

8. **Schwarzian residual for dynamic mapping.**
   Construct the variable-frequency map $\zeta(u)$ that matches the turning point and Bessel core. Compute its Schwarzian

```math
\{\zeta,u\}
=
\frac{\zeta'''}{\zeta'}-\frac32\left(\frac{\zeta''}{\zeta'}\right)^2
```

on representative hard cases.

9. **Boundary cases.**
   Directly verify or isolate separate proofs for

```math
n=0,\qquad \alpha=0,\qquad \beta=0,\qquad \alpha=\frac12,\qquad \beta=\frac12.
```

10. **Semi-discrete target.**
   Because the dispersive application only needs $\beta\in\mathbb N_0$, explicitly test $\beta=0,1,2,5,10$ and compare with large-$\beta$ behavior. The worst case may not be the Laguerre face.

Research strategy adjustment:

The next round should execute a controlled pivot.

First, make the first-lobe reduction fully formal and commit it to the lemma bank. This is now the most reliable certified progress. A1 and A3 should remove all ambiguity around the turning point, the no-critical-point case, and the degenerate boundary parameters.

Second, stop treating the rational coordinate as a solution. The rational coordinate is algebraically valuable, and the identity $v\widehat q_B=K_B$ should be retained. But Round 13 shows it is not an automatic way to beat Liouville-Green amplitude inflation.

Third, downgrade A2’s negative claims from “routes are impossible” to “naive versions are structurally obstructed.” This matters. A dynamic Bessel/Szegő method may still be the right analytic tool, but it must absorb the frequency drift rather than perturb around a constant frequency.

Fourth, split the amplitude problem into two disciplined tracks:

**Track A: Dynamic analytic track.**
Build either a modified Prüfer/Airy theorem or a Szegő variable-frequency theorem. The goal is a large-$n$ theorem with explicit constants in the residual strip.

**Track B: Certified computational track.**
Build the interval machinery now, but do not present it as proof until Track A gives a finite $N_0$ or the computation itself includes a rigorous infinite-family argument.

Fifth, keep the Laguerre cap as a boundary diagnostic, not as the main proof. The old global Laguerre target was too broad. The relevant tests are cap and first-lobe tests.

Next-round prompts by agent:

For A1:

You are A1, the broad strategist, proof synthesizer, and judge candidate. Your Round 14 task is to write the theorem-level first-lobe reduction in final form and begin the dynamic amplitude proof architecture.

Objectives:

1. State a complete right endpoint cap theorem with exact hypotheses:
   - $n\ge1$;
   - $\alpha>1/2$;
   - $\beta\ge0$;
   - $B=n+\alpha+\beta+1$;
   - $u=B(1-x)/2$;
   - central, energy, and small-exponent modules already clear their regions.

2. Prove the cap localization:
   - exact endpoint ODE;
   - $u_\sigma=nB/(B+n-1)\le n$;
   - $K_B$ quadratic and increasing on the cap;
   - sharpened $K_B'(u)\ge\alpha/2$.

3. Prove the forbidden-zone ascent lemma completely. Include:
   - Frobenius normalization;
   - positivity of $H$ near zero;
   - positivity and monotonicity of $W=p_BH'$;
   - no-zero and no-local-maximum conclusions;
   - the case where no turning point occurs inside the cap.

4. Prove the first-lobe reduction with no hidden limiting step:
   - if $u_1$ exists, any cap failure occurs at $u_1$;
   - if $u_1$ does not exist, the cap is controlled;
   - handle $q_B=0$ by an $\varepsilon$-argument or an Airy-layer statement.

5. Begin, but do not overclaim, one dynamic amplitude route. Choose either:
   - modified Prüfer variables with Airy matching;
   - Szegő/Liouville-Green variable-frequency transformation.

6. State exactly what theorem remains open after your reduction. Do not claim KKT is proved unless the first-lobe amplitude theorem is proved with constants.

Exploratory allocation:

Spend about 20% of your response comparing modified Prüfer and Szegő routes. Identify which one is more likely to produce explicit constants.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Include a section titled “Formal theorem statement for the lemma bank” and a section titled “What would falsify this route.”

For A2:

You are A2, the obstruction finder and referee-style strategist. Your Round 14 task is to convert your Round 13 obstruction analysis into precise, checkable theorems or calibrated warnings.

Objectives:

1. Derive the exact Liouville normal form in the affine $u$ coordinate, including:
   - dependent-variable transformation;
   - transformed potential;
   - Schwarzian or equivalent correction term;
   - exact residual relative to the proposed Bessel core.

2. Derive the exact Liouville normal form in the rational $v$ coordinate, including the same data. Confirm whether the residual error functional is identical, smaller, or merely reparameterized.

3. Prove or downgrade the constant-frequency Volterra blowup claim. If proving it, state a precise theorem on a parameter curve such as

```math
\alpha=cn,\qquad \beta=0,\qquad 0<c<1.
```

Identify the exact residual integral and show its asymptotic order. If the exact residual does not grow like your model, report that.

4. Audit the Sonin handoff obstruction precisely. Distinguish:
   - impossible handoff at $q_B=0$;
   - possible handoff at $u_h>u_0$ with full derivative-energy bound;
   - Airy/Prüfer alternatives.

5. Construct the variable-frequency Szegő map candidate. Write the differential equation defining $\zeta(u)$ and derive the Schwarzian term that must be bounded.

6. State whether the rational coordinate has any remaining practical value for computation or symbolic simplification, even if it does not change the invariant product.

Exploratory allocation:

Spend about 20% on an alternative product-formula or Christoffel-kernel route, but only if you can state exact positivity or kernel inequalities that would imply the KKT target.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Separate “proved obstruction,” “strong heuristic warning,” and “open diagnostic.” Avoid declaring a route dead unless the proof covers all reasonable variants.

For A3:

You are A3, the algebra checker and endpoint-reduction auditor. Your Round 14 task is to produce lemma-bank-ready algebra, with no confusing intermediate false starts.

Objectives:

1. Write a clean proof of the affine endpoint ODE:

```math
(p_BH')'+q_BH=0.
```

Explicitly show the chain-rule factors and the division by $B$.

2. Verify and record:
   - $p_B$;
   - $q_B$;
   - $K_B=p_Bq_B$;
   - $\Lambda_B$;
   - $\Delta_B$;
   - $u_\sigma$;
   - $K_B'(u_\sigma)$;
   - the sharpened lower bound $K_B'(u)\ge\alpha/2$.

3. Verify the degenerate cases:
   - $\alpha=\beta=0$;
   - $\alpha=0<\beta$;
   - $\alpha=1/2,\beta=0$;
   - $n=0$.

4. Write a clean proof of the rational-coordinate equation:

```math
(vH_v')'+\widehat q_B(v)H=0,
```

with

```math
\widehat q_B(v)
=
\frac{\kappa B}{(B+v)^2}
-
\frac{(\beta v-\alpha B)^2}{4v(B+v)^2}.
```

5. Prove

```math
v\widehat q_B(v)=K_B(u(v)).
```

6. Audit A2’s claimed frequency drift identity

```math
\Lambda_\infty-\Lambda_B
=
\frac{(\alpha+1)(n+1)}{2B}.
```

State exact definitions of $\Lambda_\infty$ and $\Lambda_B$ before proving or correcting it.

7. Audit the Bessel normalization

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
=
\sqrt{
\frac{\Gamma(n+\alpha+1)\Gamma(B)}
{\Gamma(n+1)\Gamma(B-\alpha)}
}
(B\Lambda_B)^{-\alpha/2}.
```

Attempt a first rigorous gamma-ratio inequality using a named inequality with stated hypotheses. If no useful bound follows, report the obstruction.

Exploratory allocation:

Spend about 20% checking whether a Christoffel-Darboux or Turán identity gives a pointwise bound at the first critical point. Do not overclaim; the deliverable is algebraic feasibility.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Include sections titled “Certified identities,” “Rejected identities,” and “Open analytic estimates.” Everything marked certified should be ready to paste into the lemma bank.

For A4:

You are A4, the technical lemma generator and symbolic/numeric check planner. Your Round 14 task is to build a reliable numerical map of the first-lobe problem and correct all unsupported constants.

Objectives:

1. Correctly enclose the first maximum of $J_{1/2}$. Use

```math
\tan t=2t
```

and report a rigorous interval for both $t_1$ and $J_{1/2}(t_1)$. The target value is near

```math
0.6791921047.
```

2. Investigate the full Bessel maximum

```math
B_*=\sup_{\nu\ge1/2,t\ge0}|J_\nu(t)|.
```

Either cite a precise theorem with hypotheses or design an interval proof over $\nu$ and $t$. Do not assert monotonicity in $\nu$ without proof.

3. Compute high-precision maps of

```math
R_{n,\alpha}^{\mathrm{Lag,cap}}
=
\sup_{0\le u\le n}
\frac{|\ell_n^{(\alpha)}(u)|}
{\left(\frac{n+1}{n+\alpha+1}\right)^{1/4}}
```

and separately the first-lobe ratio.

4. Compute finite-$B$ first-lobe ratios

```math
R_{n,\alpha,B}^{(1)}
=
\frac{|H(u_1)|}
{
\left(
\frac{(n+1)B}{(n+\alpha+1)(B-\alpha)}
\right)^{1/4}
}
```

over representative grids:
   - $1\le n\le200$;
   - $1/2\le\alpha\le\alpha_E(n)$;
   - $\beta=0,1,2,5,10,100,\infty$;
   - compactified $\theta=(n+\alpha+1)/B$.

5. Compute the gamma normalization

```math
M_{n,\alpha,B}
```

on the same grids. Locate the maximum and test possible upper bounds such as

```math
M\le1+\frac{C}{n+1}.
```

Report the smallest plausible $C$ observed, but do not call it proved.

6. Numerically evaluate the exact Liouville residuals supplied by A2 in both $u$ and $v$ coordinates. Compare their scaling for $\alpha=cn$, $\beta=0$.

7. Build the interval arithmetic plan but label it as a plan:
   - variables $(\alpha,\theta,u)$ for fixed $n$;
   - stable finite ${}_2F_1$ evaluation;
   - rigorous treatment of $\theta=0$ Laguerre face;
   - interval Newton isolation of critical points;
   - endpoint boxes;
   - dependency control for gamma ratios.

Exploratory allocation:

Spend about 20% testing the modified Prüfer amplitude integral numerically. Plot or tabulate whether oscillatory cancellation appears strong enough to support a large-$n$ theorem.

Required output:

Use the Stage A schema. Separate “certified interval enclosures,” “high-precision experiments,” and “proof plans.” Do not state an $N_0$ unless it follows from a proved analytic inequality.

Confidence:

Confidence in the exact affine endpoint ODE: $0.95$.

Confidence in the cap length formula $u_\sigma\le n$: $0.99$.

Confidence in the quadratic product formula and cap monotonicity: $0.95$.

Confidence in the sharpened lower bound $K_B'(u)\ge\alpha/2$ on the residual cap: $0.90$.

Confidence in the forbidden-zone ascent lemma after polishing boundary cases: $0.85$.

Confidence in the first-lobe reduction after the turning-point limiting argument is written cleanly: $0.80$.

Confidence that Round 13 proves the first-lobe amplitude estimate: $0.10$.

Confidence that A4’s claimed gamma/Bessel/Olver closure is valid as written: $0.10$.

Confidence that naive constant-frequency Bessel comparison is too lossy in the $\alpha=O(n)$ strip: $0.75$.

Confidence that the rational coordinate is not an automatic amplitude fix: $0.90$.

Confidence that a dynamic Prüfer/Airy or Szegő/Liouville-Green route is the best analytic path for the next round: $0.60$.

Confidence that certified computation will eventually be useful once a large-$n$ threshold is obtained: $0.70$.

Overall confidence that the full real-parameter KKT conjecture is proved at this stage: $0.15$.

Overall confidence that the endpoint-cap first-lobe route is the best current strategy: $0.80$.

Overall judge decision:

Record Round 13 as a successful certification round for the endpoint-cap and first-lobe reduction, not as a closure round. Add the endpoint ODE, cap length, product monotonicity, sharpened derivative lower bound, forbidden-zone ascent, rational-coordinate ODE, and invariant product identity to the lemma bank with the statuses stated above. Do not add any Bessel maximum theorem, gamma-ratio bound, Olver error theorem, or interval verification as proved. Round 14 should be a disciplined amplitude round: A1 and A3 make the reduction airtight, A2 derives exact dynamic normal forms and residuals, and A4 maps the first-lobe ratios and constants without overclaiming.

## Lemma Bank

# Lemma Bank

## Proven Or Literature-Backed

### Integer KKT bound

For $\alpha,\beta\in\mathbb N_0$, KKT prove $|g_n^{(\alpha,\beta)}(x)|\le1$ on $[-1,1]$ using finite-dimensional $SU(2)$ representation theory.

Status: literature-backed.

### Nearby real-parameter Bernstein inequality

Haagerup-Schlichtkrull prove a real-parameter uniform Bernstein-type inequality for Jacobi functions. It is valuable context but does not imply the sharp KKT $\sup |g_n|\le1$ bound.

Status: literature-backed but insufficient for KKT.

## Working Lemmas To Audit

### Central-region clearance

Claim: existing contour or energy arguments clear the central region before the endpoint cap.

Needed: exact statement, parameter range, and sharp comparison with the KKT target constant.

### Endpoint cap localization

Claim: after central clearance, the right endpoint residual can be written with $u=B(1-x)/2$ and satisfies $0\le u\le u_\sigma\le n$.

Needed: verify algebra, define $\sigma$, and check all parameter restrictions.

### Exact endpoint differential equation

Claim: the endpoint-normalized Jacobi expression satisfies a self-adjoint equation

```math
(p_B(u)H'(u))' + q_B(u)H(u)=0
```

with explicit $p_B,q_B$ and a quadratic $p_Bq_B$.

Needed: rederive from the Jacobi differential equation and confirm normalization does not affect the ODE.

### Laguerre or Bessel first-lobe certificate

Claim: a local first-lobe certificate in the remaining strip is enough to close the endpoint cap.

Needed: exact inequality, constants, domain, and relation to the KKT target factor.

### Finite-beta bridge

Claim: finite-$\beta$ Jacobi endpoint behavior can be controlled by a Laguerre-limit certificate with a strict margin.

Needed: effective perturbation bound, not just pointwise convergence.

## Rejected Or Risky Lemmas

- Non-effective asymptotics without explicit error constants.
- Crude Sobolev or Christoffel bounds that miss the sharp constant.
- Turan-type inequalities unless they directly control the single weighted normalized polynomial.
- Pure numerical evidence without interval-arithmetic or certified finite verification.

## Gap Register

# Gap Register

## G1: Sharp Constants In Endpoint Certificate

The remaining Laguerre/Jacobi endpoint estimate needs explicit constants strong enough for the KKT target. Existing sketches often identify the right region but do not close the numerical margin.

Next check: ask agents to produce a concrete inequality with all constants and state where it is strict.

## G2: Finite-Beta Bridge

Passing from a Laguerre limit to finite $\beta$ is not automatic. A bridge must quantify the error uniformly over the endpoint cap and preserve a strict margin.

Next check: derive a perturbation equation in $1/B$ and bound its effect on extrema or Sonin energy.

## G3: Central/Endpoint Interface

The claim $u_\sigma\le n$ is promising but must be verified with exact definitions and parameter restrictions.

Next check: rederive $\sigma$, $B$, and $u_\sigma$ from first principles.

## G4: Literature Status

The conjecture appears open, but any proof attempt should keep checking whether a known sharp Jacobi inequality already implies a special case.

Next check: maintain `human/references.md` with exact citations and theorem hypotheses.

## G5: Legacy Proof Claims

Several legacy files contain ambitious "proof architecture" language. Treat them as hypotheses to audit, not established proof.

Next check: require every agent to label inherited claims as certified, plausible, or rejected.

## Best Proof Draft

# Best Proof Draft

No complete proof is currently certified.

## Conditional Architecture

1. Reduce by symmetry to the right endpoint.
2. Use central-region and energy estimates to remove the bulk of $[-1,1]$.
3. Write the remaining endpoint cap with $u=B(1-x)/2$, where $B=n+\alpha+\beta+1$.
4. Prove the exact endpoint ODE and a Sonin or comparison principle for the endpoint-normalized function.
5. Establish a sharp first-lobe Laguerre/Bessel certificate in the remaining strip.
6. Quantify the finite-$\beta$ bridge so the Jacobi endpoint cap inherits the certificate.
7. Mirror the argument at the left endpoint.

## What Would Count As A Proof

A complete proof must provide:

- exact parameter ranges for every reduction,
- a theorem-level endpoint certificate with explicit constants,
- a rigorous bridge between Laguerre and finite-$\beta$ Jacobi behavior,
- certified finite verification for any residual compact set,
- no appeal to non-effective asymptotics where the target constant is sharp.
